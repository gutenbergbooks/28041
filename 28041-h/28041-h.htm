<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>THE LIFE OF BROWNING</h3>


<p>Robert Browning, the poet, was the third of that name. The first Robert
Browning, a man of energy and ability, held an important post in the
Bank of England. His wife, Margaret Tittle, was a Creole from the West
Indies, and at the time of her marriage her property was still in the
estates owned by her father near St. Kitts. When their son, the second
Robert, was seven years of age, his mother died, and his father
afterwards married again. The second wife's ascendency over her husband
was unfortunately exerted against the best interests of the son. His
desire to become an artist, his wish for a university training, were
disregarded, and he was sent instead to St. Kitts, where he was given
employment on his mother's sugar plantations. The breach between Robert
and his father became absolute when the boy defied local prejudice by
teaching a negro to read, and when, because of what his father
considered a sentimental objection to slavery, he finally refused to
remain in the West Indies. The young man returned to England and at
twenty-two started on an independent career as a clerk in the Bank of
England. In 1811 he married Sarah Anne Wiedemann. They settled in
Camberwell, London, where Robert, the poet, was born, May 7, 1812, and
his sister Sarianna in 1814.</p>

<p>Browning's father was a competent official in the Bank and a successful
business man, but his tastes were &aelig;sthetic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> and literary, and his
leisure time was accordingly devoted to such pursuits as the collection
of old books and manuscripts. He also read widely in both classic and
modern literatures. The first book of the <i>Iliad</i> he knew by heart, and
all the <i>Odes</i> of Horace, and he was accustomed to soothe his child to
sleep by humming to him snatches of Anacreon to the tune of "A Cottage
in the Wood." Mr. Browning had also considerable skill in two realms of
art, for he drew vigorous portraits and caricatures, and he had, even
according to his son's mature judgment, extraordinary force and facility
in verse-making. In character he was serene, lovable, gentle,
"tenderhearted to a fault." So instinctively chivalrous was he that
there was "no service which the ugliest, oldest, crossest woman in the
world might not have exacted of him." He was a man of great physical
vigor, dying at the age of eighty-four without ever having been ill.</p>

<p>Browning's mother was the daughter of William Wiedemann, a German who
had settled in Dundee and married a Scotch wife. Mrs. Browning impressed
all who knew her by her sweetness and goodness. Carlyle spoke of her as
"the true type of a Scottish gentlewoman"; her son's friend, Mr. Kenyon,
said that such as she had no need to go to heaven, because they made it
wherever they were; and her son called her "a divine woman." She had
deep religious instincts and concerned herself particularly with her
son's moral and spiritual development. The bond between them was always
very strong, and when she died in 1849 his wife wrote, "He has loved his
mother as such passionate natures can love, and I never saw a man so
bowed down in an extremity of sorrow&mdash;never."</p>

<p>Robert Browning's childhood was passed in an unusually serene and happy
home. In <i>Development</i> he tells how, at five years of age, he was made
to understand the main<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> facts of the Trojan War by his father's clever
use of the cat, the dogs, the pony in the stable, and the page-boy, to
impersonate the heroes of that ancient conflict. Latin declensions were
taught the child by rhymes concocted by his father as memory-easing
devices. Stories and even lessons were made intelligible and vivid by
colored maps and comic drawings. Until the boy was fourteen, his
schooling was of the most casual sort, his only formal training being
such as he received in the comparatively unimportant three or four years
he spent, after he was ten, at Mr. Ready's private school. His real
education came, through all his early life, from his home. What would
now be called nature-study he pursued ardently and on his own initiative
in the home garden and neighboring fields. His love for animals was
inherited from his mother and fostered by her. He used to keep, says
Mrs. Orr in her account of his life, "owls and monkeys, magpies and
hedge-hogs, an eagle, and even a couple of large snakes, constantly
bringing home the more portable animals in his pockets and transferring
them to his mother for immediate care." Browning says that his faculty
of observation at this time would not have disgraced a Seminole Indian.
In the matter of reading he was not entirely without advice and
guidance, but was, on the whole, allowed unusual freedom of choice. He
afterwards told Mrs. Orr that Milton, Quarles, Voltaire, Mandeville, and
Horace Walpole were the authors in whom, as a boy, he particularly
delighted. His love for art was established and developed by visits to
the Dulwich picture gallery, of which he afterwards wrote to Miss
Barrett with "love and gratitude" because he had been allowed to go
there before the age prescribed by the rules, and had thus learned to
know "a wonderful Rembrandt," a Watteau, "three triumphant Murillos," a
Giorgione Music Lesson, and various Poussins. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> marked early
susceptibility to music is evidenced by an incident narrated by Mr.
Sharp: "One afternoon his mother was playing in the twilight to herself.
She was startled to hear a sound behind her. Glancing round she beheld a
little white figure distinct against an oak bookcase, and could just
discern two large wistful eyes looking earnestly at her. The next moment
the child had sprung into her arms, sobbing passionately at he knew not
what, but, as his paroxysm subsided, whispering with shy urgency: 'Play!
Play!'"</p>

<p>In various ways the boy Robert was noticeably precocious. He could not
remember a time, he said, when he did not rhyme, and his sister records
that as a very little boy he used to walk around the table "spanning out
on the smooth mahogany the scansion of verses he had composed." Some of
these early lines he could recall and he could recall, too, the
prodigious satisfaction with which he uttered them, especially the
sentence he put into the mouth of a man who had just committed
murder&mdash;"Now my soul is satisfied." At twelve he had a volume named
<i>Incondita</i> ready for publication. To discerning eyes the little volume
was a production of great promise, dominated though it was by the
influence of his father's idol, Pope, and of his own temporary ruling
deity, Byron. But a publisher was not found, and in later years, at
Browning's request, the two extant manuscript copies of <i>Incondita</i> were
destroyed, along with many others of his youthful poems that had been
preserved by his father.</p>

<p>Browning's early tastes in the realm of poetry were, on the whole,
romantic. "Now here is the truth," he wrote to Miss Barrett, "the first
book I ever bought in my life was Ossian&mdash;and years before that the
first <i>composition</i> I ever was guilty of was something in <i>imitation</i> of
Ossian whom I had not read, but <i>conceived</i>, through two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
scraps in other books." But the decisive literary influence was yet to
come. When he was fourteen he happened to see on a bookstall a volume
marked, "Mr. Shelley's Atheistical Poem. Very Scarce"; and he at once
wished to know more of this Mr. Shelley. After a perplexing search his
mother found the desired poems, most of them in first editions, at the
Olliers, Vere Street, London. She took home also three volumes by
another poet, John Keats, who, she was told, was the subject of an elegy
by Shelley. Browning never forgot the May evening when he first read
these new books, to the accompaniment, he said, of two nightingales, one
in a copper-beech, one in a laburnum, each striving to outdo the other
in melody. A new imaginative world was opened to the boy. In
<i>Memorabilia</i> he afterwards recorded the strong intellectual and
emotional excitement, the thrill and ecstasy of this poetical
experience. To Shelley especially did he give immediate and fervid
personal loyalty, even to the extent of endeavoring to follow him in
"atheism" and vegetarianism.</p>

<p>When at fourteen the boy left Mr. Ready's school it was decided that his
further education should be carried on at home under private tutors. He
studied music under able masters, one in thorough-bass, and one in
execution. He played and sang, and he composed spirited settings for
songs. He read voraciously. He took lessons in dancing, riding, boxing,
and fencing, and is said to have shown himself exceptionally active and
vigorous. He kept up his interest in art, and he practiced drawing from
casts. He found time also for various friendships. For Miss Eliza and
Miss Sarah Flower, two sisters, nine and seven years his senior, he had
a deep affection. Both young ladies were gifted in music, and this was
one source of their attractions for the music-loving boy. Miss Sarah
Flower wrote sacred hymns, the best known of which is "Nearer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> my God to
Thee," and her sister composed music which Browning, even in his mature
years, ranked as of especial significance. Other friends of this period
were Joseph Arnold, afterwards Chief Justice of Bombay, and a man of
great ability; Alfred Domett, a striking and interesting personality
described by Browning in a poem beginning "What's Become of Waring," and
referred to in "<a href="#Page_130">The Guardian Angel</a>"; and the three Silverthorne boys,
his cousins, the death of one of whom was the occasion of the poem "<a href="#Page_425">May
and Death</a>."</p>

<p>In spite of friends, a beautiful home, and congenial work, this period
of home tutelage does not seem to have been altogether happy. His sister
in commenting on this period said, "The fact was, poor boy, he had
outgrown his social surroundings. They were absolutely good, but they
were narrow; it could not be otherwise; he chafed under them."
Furthermore, the youth, before he had found his real work as a poet, was
restless, irritable, and opinionated; and an ever-present cause of
friction was the fact that there were few subjects of taste on which he
and his father did not disagree. Their poetic tastes were especially at
variance. The father counted Pope supreme in poetry, and it was many
years before he could take pleasure in the form in which his son's
genius expressed itself. All the more noteworthy, then, is the
generosity with which Mr. Browning looked after his son's interests
through the unprofitable early years of his poetic career, a generosity
never lost sight of by the son. Mr. Sharp in his <i>Life of Browning</i>
records some words uttered by Mr. Browning a week or two before his
death, which show how permanent was his sense of indebtedness to his
father. "It would have been quite unpardonable in my case," he said,
"not to have done my best. My dear father put me in a condition most
favorable for the best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> work I was capable of. When I think of the many
authors who have had to fight their way through all sorts of
difficulties, I have no reason to be proud of my achievements.... He
secured for me all the care and comfort that a literary man needs to do
good work. It would have been shameful if I had not done my best to
realize his expectations of me."</p>

<p>After it was determined that Robert should "commence poet," he and his
father came to the conclusion that a university training had many
elements foreign to the aim the youth had set before him, and that a
richer and more directly available preparation could be gained from
"sedulous cultivation of the powers of his mind" at home, and from
"seeing life in the best sense" at home and abroad. Mrs. Orr tells us
that the first qualifying step of the zealous young poet was to read and
digest the whole of Dr. Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p>Browning's first published poem, <i>Pauline</i>, appeared anonymously in
January, 1833, when he was twenty years old. This poem is of especial
autobiographical interest. Its enthusiastic praise of Shelley recalls
his early devotion to that poet, and in many scattered passages we find
references to his own personality or experiences. The following lines
show with what intensity he recreated the lives and scenes in the books
he read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I myself went with the tale&mdash;a god<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wandering after beauty, or a giant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing vast in the sunset&mdash;an old hunter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talking with gods, or a high-crested chief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sailing with troops of friends to Tenedos.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tell you, naught has ever been so clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the place, the time, the fashion of those lives:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had not seen a work of lofty art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor woman's beauty, nor sweet nature's face,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, I say, never morn broke clear as those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the dim clustered isles in the blue sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deep groves and white temples and wet caves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nothing ever will surprise me now&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who stood beside the naked Swift-footed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who bound my forehead with Proserpine's hair.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is true and powerful self-analysis in the lines beginning:</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I am made up of an intensest life;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the invocation in lines 811-854 reveals the passionately religious
nature of the young poet. In <i>The Early Writings of Robert Browning</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Mr. Gosse gives an account of the impression made by this poem upon men
so diverse as the Rev. William Johnson Fox, John Stuart Mill, and Dante
Gabriel Rossetti, to all of whom, in spite of its crudities and very
evident immaturity, it seemed a production of exceptional promise.</p>

<p>After an interval of two years Browning published, this time under his
own name, a second long poem. The subject, Paracelsus, had been
suggested by the friend, Am&eacute;de&eacute; de Ripert-Monclar, to whom the poem is
dedicated. In pursuance of his purposed rehabilitation of a vanished age
Browning made extensive researches in the British Museum into the
history of Paracelsus, the great leader in sixteenth century medical
science; but in the poem the facts are subordinated to a minute analysis
of the spiritual history of Paracelsus. The poem was too abstruse in
subject and style to bring Browning popularity, but his genius was
recognized by important critics, and, though he was but twenty-three, he
was admitted into the foremost literary circles of London. One of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> his
most distinguished new friends was Mr. Macready, the great actor. It was
at his house that Browning first met Mr. Forster, who had already
written favorable critiques of <i>Paracelsus</i>, one for <i>The Examiner</i> and
one for <i>The New Monthly Magazine</i>. Other literary associates of this
period were Leigh Hunt, Barry Cornwall, Sergeant Talfourd, Dickens, and
Walter Savage Landor. There were not infrequent dinners and suppers to
which the young poet was welcomed. He is described as being at this
period singularly handsome. "He looks and acts," said Mr. Macready,
"more like a youthful poet than any man I ever saw." He had
sculpturesque masses of dark wavy hair, a skin like delicate ivory,
deep-set, expressive eyes, and a sensitive mouth. He was slender,
graceful, and most attractive in manner, and he was something of a dandy
in his attention to dress. He is said to have made an especially good
impression on one occasion when the circumstances must have been as
trying as they were exhilarating. In May, 1836, a group of poets had
assembled at Mr. Talfourd's to celebrate Macready's successful
production of Talfourd's <i>Ion</i>. Browning sat opposite Macready, who was
between Wordsworth and Landor. When Talfourd proposed a toast, "The
Poets of England," he spoke in complimentary terms of Wordsworth and
Landor, but called for a response from "the youngest of the Poets of
England, the author of <i>Paracelsus</i>." Landor raised his cup to the young
man, and Wordsworth shook hands with him across the table, saying, "I am
proud to know you, Mr. Browning."</p>

<p>Browning's third literary venture was a tragedy, <i>Strafford</i>, dedicated
to Macready, at whose request it was written. The drama presents the
impeachment, condemnation, and execution of the Earl of Strafford, a
statesman who, according to the play, loved the unworthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> King Charles
the First and sacrificed everything, even to life itself, in his blind
loyalty to a master who treacherously deserted him in the hour of need.
It was a topic to which Browning had already given much thought, for he
had the preceding year completed, from materials supplied by Mr. John
Forster, a <i>Life of Strafford</i> begun by Forster for Lardner's <i>Eminent
British Statesmen</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The question of the historic truthfulness of the
drama is discussed by the historian Gardiner in the Introduction to Miss
Emily H. Hickey's edition of <i>Strafford</i>. He shows that the play is in
its details and "even in the very roots of the situation" untrue to
fact, and yet he maintains that in the chief characters there is
essential truth of conception. "Every time that I read the play," says
Gardiner, "I feel more certain that Browning has seized the real
Strafford ... Charles, too, with his faults, perhaps exaggerated, is
nevertheless the real Charles." The play was produced at Covent Garden
Theater in May, 1837, with Macready as Strafford and Miss Helen Faucit
as Lady Carlisle, and was successful in spite of poor scenery and
costuming and poor acting in some of the parts. But owing to the
financial condition of the theater and the consequent withdrawal of one
of the important actors after the fifth night, the play had but a brief
run. It was presented again in 1886 under the auspices of the Browning
Society, and its power as an acting play "surprised and impressed" the
audience.</p>

<p>Before the composition of <i>Strafford</i> Browning had begun a long poem,
<i>Sordello</i>, which he completed after his first visit to Italy in 1838,
and published in 1840. No one of his poems is more difficult to read,
and many are the stories told of the dismay occasioned by its various<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
perplexities. The effect of this poem on Browning's fame was disastrous.
In fact, after <i>Sordello</i> there began a period, twenty years long, of
almost complete indifference in England to Browning's work. The
enthusiasm over the promise of his early poems died quite away. Late in
life Mr. Browning commented on this period of his literary career as a
time of "prolonged desolateness." Yet the years 1841-1846 are the years
in which he attained his poetic maturity, and years in which he did some
of his best work. During this period he brought out the series somewhat
fancifully called <i>Bells and Pomegranates</i>. The phrase itself comes from
<i>Exodus</i> xxviii, 33, 34. As a title Browning explained it to mean
"something like a mixture of music with discoursing, sound with sense,
poetry with thought." This cheap serial edition, the separate numbers of
which sold at first at sixpence and later at half a crown, included
<i><a href="#Page_325">Pippa Passes</a></i>, <i>King Victor and King Charles</i>, <i>Dramatic Lyrics</i>, <i>The
Return of the Druses</i>, <i>A Blot in the 'Scutcheon</i>, <i>Colombe's Birthday</i>,
<i>Dramatic Romances and Lyrics</i>, <i>Luria</i>, and <i>A Soul's Tragedy</i>.</p>

<p>All of Browning's plays except <i>Strafford</i> and <i>In a Balcony</i> came out
of this series. The most beautiful of them all, <i><a href="#Page_325">Pippa Passes</a></i>, appeared
in 1841. It is hardly a drama at all in the conventional sense, though
it has one scene, that between Ottima and Sebald, of the highest
dramatic power; but it has always been a favorite with readers. When it
was published Miss Barrett wrote to Mr. Browning that she found it in
her heart to covet the authorship of this poem more than any other of
his works, and he said in answer that he, too, liked <i>Pippa</i> better than
anything else he had yet done. Mr. Sharp, while emphasizing the
undramatic quality of the play, counts it "the most imperishable because
the most nearly immaculate of Browning's dramatic poems." "It seems to
me," he adds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> "like all simple and beautiful things, profound enough
for the sinking plummet of the most curious explorer of the depths of
life. It can be read, re-read, learned by heart, and the more it is
known the wider and more alluring are the avenues of imaginative thought
which it discloses. It has, more than any other long composition by its
author, that quality of symmetry, that <i>symmetria prisca</i> recorded of
Leonardo da Vinci in the Latin epitaph of Platino Piatto; and, as might
be expected, its mental basis, what Rossetti called fundamental brain
work, is as luminous, depth within depth, as the morning air....
Everyone who knows Browning at all knows <i><a href="#Page_325">Pippa Passes</a></i>."</p>

<p>Of the seven dramas published in <i>Bells and Pomegranates</i> there is
comparatively little stage history to record. In spite of occasional
fairly successful productions it must be admitted that Browning's plays
have never achieved, probably never will achieve, popularity in the
shape of long runs in many cities.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> They are too subjective, too
analytic, too psychological, for quick or easy understanding. But to the
reader they offer many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> delights. The stories are clear, coherent,
interesting; the characters strongly individualized; the crises of
experience stimulating; the interaction of personalities subtly
analyzed; the poetry noble and beautiful.</p>

<p>The two non-dramatic numbers of <i>Bells and Pomegranates</i> were <i>Dramatic
Lyrics</i> (No. 3, 1842) and <i>Dramatic Romances and Lyrics</i> (No. 7, 1845).
The first included such poems as "<a href="#Page_69">Cavalier Tunes</a>," "In a Gondola,"
"Porphyria," and "<a href="#Page_141">The Pied Piper of Hamelin</a>"; the second included "<a href="#Page_73">How they
Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix</a>," "<a href="#Page_72">The Lost Leader</a>," "<a href="#Page_222">The
Tomb at St. Praxed's</a>," "<a href="#Page_152">The Flight of the Duchess</a>," "<a href="#Page_137">The Boy and the
Angel</a>," and the first part of "<a href="#Page_105">Saul</a>." These poems, together with the
dramas, make a remarkably rich body of poetry to be produced in the
short space of five years. And the character of the work, its variety
and beauty and strength and originality, were such that its meager and
grudging acceptance seems now inexplicable.</p>

<p>The most important event in the life of Browning during this period was
his acquaintance with Miss Elizabeth Barrett. In 1844 she brought out a
new volume of poems which he saw and greatly admired. He wrote to her
expressing delight in her work and asking permission to call; but Miss
Barrett, owing to long-continued invalidism, had lived in almost entire
seclusion, and she was not at first willing to receive Mr. Browning.
This was in January, 1845, and many letters passed between them before
the first interview in the following May. Mr. Browning's love for Miss
Barrett found almost immediate expression and she was soon conscious of
an equally strong love for him, but for a considerable time she
persistently refused to marry him. To her mind the obstacles were almost
insurmountable. Of these her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> ill-health was chief. She could not
consent, she said, to dim the prosperities of his career by a union with
her future, which she characterized as a precarious thing, a thing for
making burdens out of&mdash;but not for his carrying. In exchange for the
"noble extravagancies" of his love she could bring him only "anxiety and
more sadness than he was born to." This obstacle of ill-health was
unexpectedly modified by a very mild winter and by the new physical
vigor brought in the train of new happiness. From this point of view the
marriage, though hazardous, was practicable by the end of the summer of
1846. A second obstacle lay in the nature and opinions of Miss Barrett's
father, who governed even his grown-up children by "an incredible system
of patriarchal absolutism." By what was variously termed an obliquity of
the will, an eccentricity, a monomania, he had decided that none of his
children should marry, and on this point he demanded "passive
obedience." It was perfectly clear that Miss Barrett could not gain his
consent to her marriage, and so, after long hesitation and much
unhappiness, she decided to marry Mr. Browning without that consent. In
order to save her family and close friends from the blame sure to fall
upon them for the remotest sanction of her marriage, her plans were kept
an absolute secret. She met Mr. Browning at Marylebone Church on
September 12, 1846, and they were married there, Mrs. Browning returning
at once to her own home, where she remained till a week later, when she
started for Italy with her husband. The wedding was then announced.
Throughout her father's life Mrs. Browning endeavored to placate him,
for she devotedly loved him and she had been his favorite child, but in
vain. He would never see her again, he returned her letters unopened,
and he would not allow her to be spoken of in his presence.</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
After resting a week in Paris Mr. and Mrs. Browning went on to Pisa,
where they remained nearly seven months. The "miracle" of the Pisa life
was Mrs. Browning's gain in health. "You are not <i>improved</i>, you are
<i>transformed</i>," was Mrs. Jameson's exclamation. It was at Pisa that Mr.
Browning came to know of the sonnets his wife had written during the
progress of their courtship and engagement. In <i>Critical Kit-Kats</i>
(1896) Mr. Gosse tells the story as Mr. Browning gave it to him: "One
day, early in 1847, their breakfast being over, Mrs. Browning went
upstairs, while her husband stood at the window watching the street till
the table could be cleared. He was presently aware of someone behind
him, although the servant had gone. It was Mrs. Browning who held him by
the shoulder to prevent his turning to look at her, and at the same time
pushed a packet of papers into the pocket of his coat. She told him to
read that and to tear it up if he did not like it; and then she fled
again to her room." Mr. Browning felt at once that he had no right to
keep such poetry as a private possession. "I dared not," he said,
"reserve to myself the finest sonnets written in any language since
Shakespeare's." They were accordingly published in 1850, under the
intentionally mystifying title, <i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i>.</p>

<p>The Brownings reached Florence April 20, 1847. After several changes
they were, in May, 1848, established in the home in which they remained
during Mrs. Browning's life. It was a suite of rooms on the second floor
of the Palazzo Guidi. Of the practical side of this early Florentine
life, Mrs. Browning wrote, "My dear brothers have the illusion that
nobody should marry on less than two thousand a year. Good heavens! how
preposterous it does seem to me! We scarcely spend three hundred, and I
have every luxury I ever had, and which it would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> so easy to give up,
at need; and Robert wouldn't sleep, I think, if an unpaid bill dragged
itself by any chance into another week. He says that when people get
into pecuniary difficulties his sympathies always go with the butchers
and the bakers." In accordance with this horror of owing five shillings
five days, the furnishings of the new home, "the rococo chairs, spring
sofas, carved bookcases, satin from cardinals' beds, and the rest," were
accumulated at a pace dictated by the bank account, but for all that it
was not long before the rooms began to take on an aspect as beautiful as
it was homelike.</p>

<p>By preference the Brownings lived very quietly. At the end of fifteen
months Mrs. Browning wrote, "Robert has not been out an evening of the
fifteen months; but what with music and books and writing and talking,
we scarcely know how the days go, it's such a gallop on the grass."
March 9, 1849, was born Wiedemann, later known as "Penini" or "Pen"
Browning. Coincident with this joy was the grief caused by the death of
Browning's mother, a sorrow from which he rallied but slowly. The
Florentine life was occasionally varied by summers at Bagni di Lucca,
winters in Paris or Rome, and several visits to England. There was also
an increasing social life. Americans were especially welcome to the
Brownings because, while England was still indifferent to Browning's
work, America had given it an appreciative welcome. In March, 1861, Mrs.
Browning wrote, "I don't complain for myself of an unappreciative
public. <i>I have no reason</i>. But just for <i>that</i> reason I complain more
about Robert.... In America he is a power, a writer, a poet&mdash;he is read,
he lives in the hearts of the people."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Americans associated with the Brownings for longer or shorter
periods during their life in Florence were two distinguished women,
Margaret Fuller Ossoli and Harriet Beecher Stowe. In 1847, George
William Curtis spent two days with the Brownings at Vallombrosa, a visit
later described in his <i>Easy Chair</i>. Mr. Field, who had brought out the
American reprint of the two-volume edition of Browning's poems in 1849,
was a guest at Casa Guidi in 1852. Charles Sumner writes of "delicious
Tuscan evenings" with the Brownings and the Storys in 1859. Mr.
Browning's interests in art led to friendships with American artists,
among whom were Mr. Page, who painted a successful portrait of Browning;
Miss Harriet Hosmer, to whom Mr. and Mrs. Browning finally consented to
sit for the "Clasped Hands"; and Hiram Powers. The dearest American
friends were, however, Mr. and Mrs. Hawthorne and Mr. and Mrs. Story.</p>

<p>Music and art were among Browning's chief delights in Florence. George
William Curtis in describing the trip to Vallombrosa says that it was
part of their pleasure to sit in the dusky convent chapel while Browning
at the organ "chased a fugue of Master Hughes of Saxe Gotha, or dreamed
out upon twilight keys a faint throbbing toccata of Galuppi's." Modeling
in clay was even more satisfying as a personal resource. In the autumn
of 1860 Mrs. Browning wrote, "Robert has taken to modeling under Mr.
Story (at his studio) and is making extraordinary progress, turning to
account his studies in anatomy. He has copied already two busts, the
young Augustus and the Psyche, and is engaged on another, enchanted with
his new trade, working six hours a day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> Some months later she added,
"The modeling combines body-work and soul-work, and the more tired he
has been, and the more his back ached, poor fellow, the more he has
exulted and been happy&mdash;'<i>no, nothing ever made him so happy before</i>.'"
He found, also, an unfailing pleasure in the study of great pictures.
And he was a buyer of pictures with a collector's delight in hunting out
the work of the unappreciated early Tuscan artists. Mrs. Orr says that
he owned at least one picture by each of the obscure artists mentioned
in "<a href="#Page_91">Old Pictures in Florence</a>."</p>

<p>Mrs. Browning sometimes expressed regret that Browning should give
himself so unreservedly in so many directions, because she felt that he
had thus too little time and energy left for poetry. Her fear was not
without justification, for after the richly productive period from 1841
to 1846, we come upon a space of nine years the only publications of
which are, in 1850, <i>Christmas Eve and Easter Day</i>, a long poem in two
parts giving the arguments in favor of Christianity; and, in 1852, an
introduction to a collection of letters then supposed to be by Shelley,
but since found to be spurious. The essay is nevertheless of importance
as an exposition of Browning's theory of poetry, and as an interesting
study of Shelley.</p>

<p>In 1855, at the close of this period of nine years, there appeared a
collection of fifty-one poems entitled <i>Men and Women</i>. In "fundamental
brain power," insight, beauty, and mastery of style, these poems show
Browning at the highest level of his poetic achievement. It is in these
remarkable poems that he brought to perfection a poetic form which he
practically invented, the dramatic monologue, a form in which there is
but one speaker but which is essentially dramatic in effect. The
dramatic quality arises partly from the implied presence of listeners
whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> expressions of assent or dissent determine the progress or the
abrupt changes of direction of the speaker's words. In "Andrea del
Sarto," for example, Lucrezia's smiles and frowns and gestures of
impatience are a constant influence, and the poem presents as vivid an
interplay of personalities as any scene in a drama. But the implied
listener is hardly more than a secondary dramatic element, the chief one
being that the speaker talks, as do the characters in a play, out of the
demands of the immediate experience, gradually and casually disclosing
all the tangled web of influence, all the clashes of will with destiny,
of desire with convention, that have led to the crisis depicted. Fra
Lippo Lippi gives no consecutive history of his life, only such snatches
of it as partially account for his present mad freak, but the strife
between his own nature and instinct on the one hand and the conventions
and traditions of religious art on the other could hardly be more
vividly presented. <i>In a Balcony</i>, the one drama in <i>Men and Women</i>, has
but a fragment of a plot, but in intensity, reality, and passion it
excels most of Browning's dramas, and, in spite of its long speeches,
has proved effective on the stage.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In variety of theme,
subject-matter, and verse-form, the poems of <i>Men and Women</i> defy
classification. Whatever page one turns, there is something novel,
stimulating, captivating. All of Browning's Florentine interests are
represented here&mdash;his love of old pictures and little-known music, his
delight in Florence, Venice, Rome, in all Italy, her skies and her
landscapes, the vagrants of her streets, her religious ceremonies, her
church dignitaries, her scholars. Then there are love-poems in all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
tones and tempers, the noblest of them all, "<a href="#Page_239">One Word More</a>," being
Browning's most direct and personal tribute to his wife. And we see in
its keenest form his intellectual delight in subtle disquisition. The
doctrine of immortality as it appeals to the mind of the cultured,
dissatisfied pagan Cleon; the miracle of Lazarus as it is brooded over
by the Arab physician Karshish; the balancing of faith and doubt in the
clever casuistry of Bishop Blougram&mdash;these are topics to Browning's
taste and are treated with skill and mastery. Taken all in all these
poems give to the reader a full impression of Browning's characteristic
force, the darting, penetrating power of his phrase, the rush and energy
and leap of his thought. It is by <i>Men and Women</i>, the somewhat similar
<i>Dramatis Person&aelig;</i>, and the earlier <i>Dramatic Lyrics</i> and <i>Dramatic
Romances</i>, that Browning is most widely and most favorably known.</p>

<p>During the first ten years that the Brownings were in Florence Mrs.
Browning's health was so good that she was able to enjoy social and
outdoor pleasures to a degree that would have been thought impossible
before her marriage. She had also kept up her literary work. A new
edition of her poems appeared in 1849; in 1851 she published <i>Casa Guidi
Windows</i>, poems illustrative of her ardent interest in all that
pertained to the fight for Italian freedom; and in 1856 her long-planned
verse novel <i>Aurora Leigh</i> was completed and published. But soon after
this her strength began insensibly to fail and during the last three
years of her life she suffered much from repeated bronchial attacks.
However, her death, in June, 1861, was entirely unexpected. The
Florentines had loved her deeply and had appreciated her utterances in
behalf of a free Italy. She was, accordingly, buried in Florence, with
"extraordinary demonstrations of respect,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> and the house where she had
lived was marked by the municipality with a commemorative tablet.</p>

<p>Browning's wish was to leave Florence at once and to make the new life
as unlike the old as possible. He went to London, and after some delay
established himself in a house at Warwick Crescent, where he lived till
1887. The first portion of his life in England was one of "unbearable
loneliness." He took care of his son, busied himself with a new edition
of his wife's poems, read and studied and wrote with feverish intensity,
and avoided people. But with the spring of 1863, says Mr. Gosse, "a
great change came over Browning's habits. He had shunned all invitations
into society, but ... it suddenly occurred to him that this mode of life
was morbid and unworthy," and thereupon he entered into the social,
literary, musical, and artistic life of London.</p>

<p>The nine years following 1855 were again a period of small productivity.
<i>Dramatis Person&aelig;</i> was a slender volume to represent so many years, even
though it contained such great poems as "<a href="#Page_253">Rabbi Ben Ezra</a>," "A Death in
the Desert," and "<a href="#Page_247">Abt Vogler</a>." But during this period a long poem, <i>The
Ring and the Book</i>, had been maturing. In 1860, while still at Casa
Guidi, Browning had found at a book-stall the now famous "square old
yellow Book," containing the legal record of a famous Roman murder case.
He read the account on the way home, and before night had so mastered
the details that, as he paced up and down on the terrace in the
darkness, he saw the tragedy unfold before him in picture after picture.
It was not, however, till 1864 that he definitely set to work on the
composition of the poem. It was published in four volumes of three parts
each, in the winter and spring of 1868-9. The poem has a novel
structure. The story is retold ten times by different persons and with
such varia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>tions of fact and opinions and style as are dictated by the
knowledge and the character of the speaker. The monologues of Count
Guido, who murdered his wife, of Pompilia the young wife, of Caponsacchi
the "soldier saint" who endeavored to save her, and of the old Pope, are
by far the most interesting portions of the poem, but the whole of it is
remarkable, and it justly takes rank as one of England's greatest poems.
With the appearance of this book Browning's genius received adequate
recognition in high places. <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i> called it "the <i>opus magnum</i>
of the generation, not merely beyond all parallel the supremest poetic
achievement of the time, but the most precious and profound spiritual
treasure that England has possessed since the days of Shakespeare."</p>

<p>The last ten or twelve years of Browning's life were so crowded with
interests, occupations, publications, friends, honors, that not even a
summary of them can be undertaken here. Mr. Sharp says of this period:</p>

<p>"Everybody wished him to come and dine; and he did his best to gratify
Everybody. He saw everything; read all the notable books; kept himself
acquainted with the leading contents of the journals and magazines;
conducted a large correspondence; read new French, German, and Italian
books of mark; read and translated Euripides and &AElig;schylus; knew all the
gossip of the literary clubs, the salons, and the studios; was a
frequenter of afternoon tea parties; and then, over and above it, he was
Browning&mdash;the most profoundly subtle mind that has exercised itself in
poetry since Shakespeare."</p>

<p>Mr. Henry James in commenting on Browning's rich and ample London period
with "its felicities and prosperities of every sort," says that in
contemplating "the wonderful Browning ... the accomplished, saturated,
sane, sound man of the London world and the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> of culture," it was
impossible not to believe that "he had arrived somehow, for his own deep
purposes, at the enjoyment of a double identity," so dissociated were
the poet and the "member of society." Phillips Brooks, who met Browning
in England in 1865-6, was impressed by his fullness of life and said he
was "very like some of the best of Thackeray's London men." In public
and on ordinary social occasions Browning is said to have been frank,
charming, friendly&mdash;"more agreeable," Mary Anderson said, "than
distinguished." With intimate friends, however, the poet had quite
another sort of charm. "To a single listener," says Mr. Gosse, with whom
he was on familiar terms, "the Browning of his own study was to the
Browning of a dinner party as a tiger cat is to a domestic cat. In such
conversation his natural strength came out. His talk assumed the volume
and the tumult of a cascade. His voice rose to a shout, sank to a
whisper, ran up and down the gamut of conversational melody. Those whom
he was expecting will never forget his welcome, the loud trumpet-note
from the other end of the passage, the talk already in full flood at a
distance of twenty feet. Then, in his own study or drawing-room, what he
loved was to capture his visitor in a low armchair's 'sofa-lap of
leather,' and from a most unfair vantage of height to tyrannize, to walk
around the victim, in front, behind, on this side, on that, weaving
magic circles, now with gesticulating arms thrown high, now groveling on
the floor to find some reference in a folio, talking all the while, a
redundant turmoil of thoughts, fancies, and reminiscences flowing from
those generous lips."</p>

<p>Elsewhere Mr. Gosse summed up his personal impressions of Mr. Browning,
as follows:</p>

<p>"I am bound to tell you that I saw a different Brown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>ing from the hero
of all the handbooks and 'gospels' which are now in vogue. People are
beginning to treat this vehement and honest poet as if he were a sort of
Marcus Aurelius and John the Baptist rolled into one. I have just seen a
book in which it is proposed that Browning should supersede the Bible,
in which it is asserted that a set of his volumes will teach religion
better than all the theologies in the world. Well, I did not know that
holy monster.... What I saw was an unostentatious, keen, active man of
the world, one who never failed to give good practical advice in matters
of business and conduct, one who loved his friends and certainly hated
his enemies; a man alive in every eager passionate nerve of him; a man
who loved to discuss people and affairs, and a bit of a gossip; a bit of
a partisan, too, and not without his humorous prejudices. He was simple
to a high degree, simple in his scrupulous dress, his loud, happy voice,
his insatiable curiosity."</p>

<p>Browning's London life was varied by many summer journeyings to French
sea-coast towns, to Wales, and to Scotland. But it was seventeen years
after the death of his wife before he could bring himself to revisit
Italy. Even then he avoided Florence. He took his sister to Northern
Italy; and Asolo and Venice became the towns around which their
affections centered. Two American friends, Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore, and
Mrs. Arthur Bronson,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> contributed to the happiness of these Italian
sojourns. In 1888 Browning's son, who had married an American girl,
bought the Palazzo Rezzonico in Venice, so that Browning had an
additional personal reason for his trip to Venice in 1889. He was well,
and he took great pleasure in his son's admirably planned restoration of
the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> Venetian palace. He worked, walked, talked with nearly normal
vigor. But a bronchial attack proved more than his weakened heart could
withstand, and he died peacefully, almost painlessly, in his son's home
on December 12, 1889. On the day of his death his last book, <i>Asolando</i>,
was published, so that his brave-hearted <a href="#Page_324">"Epilogue</a>" was really his
valediction to this and his heroic greeting to another world. He could
"greet the unseen with a cheer," because in thought and act he was</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One who never turned his back but marched breast forward,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Never doubted clouds would break,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never dreamed, though right were worsted, wrong would triumph,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sleep to wake.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Browning was buried in Westminster Abbey on the last day of the year.
The most pathetic element of the imposing ceremonies was the singing of
Mrs. Browning's poem, "He Giveth His Beloved Sleep."</p>


<h3>THE POETRY OF BROWNING</h3>

<p>Before entering upon a discussion of Browning's poetry it will be of
interest to note briefly some of the more striking general
characteristics of the English literature contemporary with his work.
From <i>Pauline</i> to <i>Asolando</i> is over half a century, but as a central
and especially significant portion of Browning's career we may take the
three decades from 1841, when he began the <i>Bells and Pomegranates</i>
series, to 1869, when <i>The Ring and the Book</i> appeared, for these years
include all of his dramas and most of the poetry on which his fame
rests. A survey of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> this period at once reveals the predominance of
fiction. Within these years come nearly all the novels of Charles
Dickens, of William Makepeace Thackeray, of Charlotte Bront&euml;, of Wilkie
Collins, of Charles Kingsley, of Mrs. Gaskell, of Anthony Trollope, of
George Macdonald, of Charles Reade, much of the work of Bulwer Lytton,
all the novels of George Eliot except <i>Middlemarch</i>
and <i>Daniel Deronda</i>, and the earliest of George Meredith's books. This is a notable
showing. No previous period in English literature had presented anything
like so wide a range in fiction or had brought forward so large a number
of novels of the first rank. These years were equally rich in essays,
including much of Carlyle's work, all of Macaulay's except the early
"Essay on Milton," the religious polemics of Frederick Dennison Maurice
and John Henry Newman, nearly all of Ruskin's discussions of art and
social history, most of Leigh Hunt's literary criticism, and Matthew
Arnold's important early critical essays. This, too, is a notable
showing. But if we turn to the two realms in which Browning excelled,
poetry and drama, we find different conditions. During the central
period of his career, there was, aside from his own work, not a single
important drama published. The theaters were prosperous, but they
brought out only old plays or new ones of inferior rank. In poetry, too,
if we set aside the great names of Tennyson and Browning, the period was
neither rich nor varied. During Browning's first great productive
period, 1841-46, the only other poems of note were Tennyson's two
volumes in 1842. In the nine years from 1846 to <i>Men and Women</i> in 1855,
the chief poems were Tennyson's <i>The Princess</i>,
<i>In Memoriam</i>, and
<i>Maud</i>, for though Wordsworth's <i>Prelude</i> was one of the greatest
publications of the mid-century, it was written years before, and can
hardly be counted as belonging to this era. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> are, during the
decade, many poems of secondary rank, the most important of them being
Mrs. Browning's <i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i> and <i>Aurora Leigh</i>, but
besides Tennyson and Browning, the only poet of high rank is Matthew
Arnold, whose slender volumes voice the doubts and difficulties of the
age as Browning's poems voice its optimism. In the fourteen years
between <i>Men and Women</i> and <i>The Ring and the Book</i> poets of a new kind
appear; William Morris's <i>Defense of Guinevere</i>,
<i>The Life and Death of
Jason</i> and <i>The Earthly Paradise</i>, and Swinburne's early poems are alien
to the work of Browning in form, subject-matter, and ideals. The fact
is, the more definitely we try to place Browning in his literary
environment the more distinctly do we perceive that he was <i>sui generis</i>
among his contemporaries. He combined in striking fashion the intensity
of the poet and the strong social sense of the prose writer.</p>

<p>It seems also wise to glance at the outset at a few of the main
criticisms that have been made on Browning's poetry, for the result of
his marked originality is that no poet of the time has been so greatly
praised and blamed.</p>

<p>A natural first topic is his really famous "obscurity." This obscurity
is variously ascribed to a diction unduly learned, or almost
unintelligibly colloquial, or grotesquely inventive; to figures of
speech drawn from sources too unfamiliar or elaborated to the point of
confusion; to sentences complicated by startling inversions, by double
parentheses, by broken constructions, or by a grammatical structure
defying analysis. It would be quite possible to illustrate each of these
points from Browning's works, and it cannot be denied that his poetry is
sometimes needlessly and inexcusably hard reading. But in reality the
difficulties in his poems come less from stylistic defects than from the
subject matter. What Mr. Chesterton calls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> Browning's love for "the
holes and corners of history," leads him to the use of much unfamiliar
detail. A large part of the difficulty in reading <i>Sordello</i> arises from
the fact that all Browning's accumulated knowledge of medieval Italy is
there poured forth in an allusive, taken-for-granted manner, till even
the practiced reader turns away perplexed and overwhelmed. So, too, "<a href="#Page_91">Old
Pictures in Florence</a>," "Pictor Ignotus," and "<a href="#Page_200">Fra Lippo Lippi</a>" assume on
the part of the reader a minute familiarity with early Florentine art.
Occasionally the poems demand an exceptional technical knowledge of some
sort, as in "<a href="#Page_247">Abt Vogler</a>," where only a trained musician can fully
understand the terminology. Many even of the minor poems belong to
realms of thought and experience so remote that only by distinct effort
do we transport ourselves thither. It would, for instance, be absurd to
call "<a href="#Page_126">Two in the Campagna</a>" difficult in form or phrasing, yet it
narrates an experience intelligible only to those who have loved deeply
but have found in the very heart of that love a baffling sense of
inevitable personal isolation. Sometimes the difficulty arises from the
extreme subtlety of the thought. "<a href="#Page_78">Evelyn Hope</a>," the simplest of poems in
expression, presents novel and elusive ideas. Mr. Chesterton ingeniously
ascribes Browning's obscurity to "intellectual humility," to an
assumption that his readers were in possession of a native endowment and
an acquired intellectual wealth on a par with his own; but the defense
seems rather forced. Mrs. Browning gave one of the best brief analyses
of Mr. Browning's obscurity. He had been attacked as being "misty" and
she wrote to him, "You never <i>are</i> misty, not even in 'Sordello'&mdash;never
vague. Your graver cuts deep, sharp lines, always&mdash;and there is an extra
distinctness in your images and thoughts, from the midst of which,
crossing each other infinitely, the general significance seems to
escape." But the classic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> defense of Browning from this point of view
may be found in Swinburne's Introduction to Chapman's <i>Poems</i>:</p>

<p>"The difficulty found by many in certain of Mr. Browning's works arises
from a quality the very reverse of that which produces obscurity,
properly so-called. Obscurity is the natural product of turbid forces
and confused ideas; of a feeble and clouded or of a vigorous but unfixed
and chaotic intellect.... Now if there is any great quality more
perceptible than another in Mr. Browning's intellect it is his decisive
and incisive faculty of thought, his sureness and intensity of
perception, his rapid and trenchant resolution of aim.... The very
essence of Mr. Browning's aim and method, as exhibited in the ripest
fruits of his intelligence, is such as implies above all other things
the possession of a quality the very opposite of obscurity&mdash;a faculty of
spiritual illumination rapid and intense and subtle as lightning, which
brings to bear upon its object by way of direct and vivid illustration
every symbol and every detail on which its light is flashed in passing."
Browning has himself a word to say on this topic. He wrote to a friend:</p>

<p>"I can have little doubt that my writing has been in the main too hard
for many I should have been pleased to communicate with; but I never
designedly tried to puzzle people as some of my critics have supposed.
On the other hand, I never pretended to offer such literature as should
be a substitute for a cigar or a game at dominoes to an idle man. So,
perhaps, on the whole, I get my deserts, and something over&mdash;not a crowd
but a few I value more."</p>

<p>A second charge not infrequently brought against Browning's verse is
that it is harsh, and at times even ugly. This charge, like that of
obscurity, cannot be wholly denied. The harshness results from incorrect
rhymes, from irregular movement of the verse, or from difficult<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
combinations of vowels and consonants. No reader of Browning's poems can
fail to have been impressed by his intellectual agility in matching odd
rhymes. In dash and originality his rhymes out-rank even those in
Butler's <i>Hudibras</i> and Lowell's <i>Fable for Critics</i>. We find in
<i>Pacchiarotto</i>, for instance, many rhymes of the gayest, most freakish,
most grotesque character&mdash;"monkey, one key," "prelude, hell-hued,"
"stubborn, cub-born," "<i>was</i> hard, hazard," all occur in a single
stanza. An example of exceptional facility in rhyming is found in
"Through the Metidja," where, without repetition of words and without
forcing of the sense thirty-six words rhyme with "ride." It cannot be
denied that this remarkable facility led Browning occasionally into the
use of odd rhymes in poems where no light or comic effect was intended;
but a detailed study of his rhymes<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> shows that the proportion of
incorrect rhymes is really small, that the grotesque rhymes are more
striking than numerous, and that they are usually in places where they
are dramatically appropriate. His use of harsh words and sound-blendings
is also often to be justified on the ground of their appropriateness to
the idea. Compare, for instance, the flowing, easy words, the musical
linking of sounds, in the first stanza of "<a href="#Page_81">Love Among the Ruins</a>" with
the harsh words, harshly combined, in the twelfth and thirteenth stanzas
of "<a href="#Page_189">Childe Roland</a>." Both effects are artistic because each sort of
combination is in response to the nature of the thought. It is true that
sometimes, perhaps not infrequently, the verse is rugged or uncouth
where the sense does not call for such form, and there are lines that
not only remind us of De Quincey's dictum that certain words should be
"boiled before they are eaten," but which have no metrical flow at all;
they defy any sort of scansion and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> read like rough prose. But a poet
has a right of appeal to the sum of his manifest excellencies rather
than to his defects, and if we take Browning's best work we find a
harmony of movement superior in musical effect to a more technically
regular meter. In many poems the meter is indissolubly fused with the
pictures, the ideas, the events. Take, for instance, "<a href="#Page_141">The Pied Piper of
Hamelin</a>," where the hurry-skurry of the verse is in complete harmony
with the quaint, rapid tale. The hoof-beats of galloping horses is heard
all through "<a href="#Page_73">How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix.</a>" The slow
march, the stately chant, are rhythmically present throughout "<a href="#Page_183">A
Grammarian's Funeral</a>." In "<a href="#Page_152">The Flight of the Duchess</a>" the change from
the rough servitor's narrative to the incantation of the gypsy-queen is
as exquisitely marked in the metrical movement and in the rhymes as it
is in the diction and tone of thought. Many other examples might be
cited. Mr. Brinton, who has made a detailed and competent study of
Browning's verse, gives his final opinion in these words: "In the
volumes of Browning I maintain that we find so many instances of
profound insight into verbal harmonies, such singular strength of poetic
grouping, and such a marvelous grasp of the rhythmic properties of the
English language that we must assign to him a rank second to no English
poet of this century."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>A third charge brought against Browning's art is that he makes all his
characters talk "Browningese"; that is, that he endows all of them with
the power to use such words and sentences and thought processes as are
natural to him and to him only. Mr. Stedman in emphasizing this
characteristic of the poet says of <i><a href="#Page_325">Pippa Passes</a></i>: "The usual fault is
present&mdash;the characters, whether students,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> peasants, or soldiers, all
talk like sages; Pippa reasons like a Paracelsus in pantalettes." It is,
of course, obvious at the first glance that there is a lack of
verisimilitude in Pippa's rich and beautiful soliloquies. Certainly no
fourteen-year-old mill girl could so describe a sunrise, or play so
brilliantly with a sunbeam in a water-basin, or outline so cleverly the
stories of the happiest four in Asolo. The same is true of Phene's long
speech to Jules; no untutored girl brought up in degradation, could
present such thoughts in such words. When we analyze Browning's way of
presenting a character, however, we find that the lack of verisimilitude
is usually external and has to do chiefly with expression. Browning
works on the fundamental assumption that he has a poetic right to make
all sorts of people articulate. He lends his mind out in the service of
their thoughts and feelings. He makes people reveal themselves by
putting into words their elusive, dim, tangled, and even unrecognized
motives and hopes and joys and despairs. He sums up in the speeches all
the potentialities of the situation. All the significance latent in the
type of character and environment is somehow heightened and symbolized.
All this is put in his own highly individual diction. Yet it can hardly
be said that he violates poetic realism in the deeper sense, for he
never puts a halo around a situation, never goes counter to its
potentialities. Instead he strikes fire from it. He shows what is
actually in the situation, but at white heat and laid bare to its
center. When this method has once been recognized, discomfort on the
score of lack of verisimilitude practically disappears, and the reader
yields himself to the joy of the rich, subtle, and stimulating analysis.</p>

<p>We may now turn to a consideration of the subject-matter and the main
ideas of Browning's poetry. From whatever point of view we regard his
work, we find that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> ultimately the emphasis rests on the same great
central fact, the supremacy of his interest in human nature. This
dominating interest is shown, for instance, by a study of his treatment
of physical nature. To be sure, no one can read his poems without
recognizing the truth that his use of natural facts is distinctive in
kind and very stimulating. A mere reference to the pictures of the sky
in <i><a href="#Page_325">Pippa Passes</a></i>, the vivid descriptions of fruits and flowers in "An
Englishman in Italy," the remarkable studies of small animal life in
"<a href="#Page_105">Saul</a>" and "<a href="#Page_260">Caliban upon Setebos</a>," of birds in "<a href="#Page_103">Home-Thoughts, from
Abroad</a>," of insects in the first part of <i>Paracelsus</i> and in many later
poems, suffices to show that in mature life he did not lose the keenness
of observation and interest characteristic of his youth. Yet it is also
evident that his use of nature by way of direct description, or even as
illustrative material, is far less in amount than that of other notable
nineteenth century poets. He cares much less for "the river's line, the
mountains round it and the sky above" than for the "figures of man,
woman, and child these are frame to." Where nature is drawn upon, it is
almost invariably in complete subordination to some human interest, and
its literary form is almost always that of casual mention, background,
or similitude, and the first of these is the most frequent. Furthermore,
nearly all these passages are a mere statement of observed fact without
comment or interpretation. There is one great passage in <i>Paracelsus</i>
where the joy of God in the act of creation is depicted; there are
occasional references to the delight of man in the external world; and
now and then, as in "By the Fireside," man and nature are intimately
fused; but such conceptions rarely occur. In Browning's poetry the
boundary lines between man and nature are clearly marked. In
<i>Paracelsus</i> he definitely protests against man's way of reading his own
moods into nature, and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> attributing to her his own qualities and
emotions. He also always accounts man, if he has truly entered into his
spiritual heritage, as consciously superior to nature. The troubadour
Eglamour, in <i>Sordello</i>, says that man shrinks to naught if matched with
a quiet sea or sky, but Browning calls that Eglamour's "false thought."
To Browning, nature was to be studied, enjoyed, and used, but it was not
as to Keats a realm of enchantment; or as to Wordsworth the realm where
alone the divine and the human could pass the boundaries of sense and
meet; or as to Matthew Arnold a refuge from pain and disillusionment.
Browning regards the world about him more in the sane, unsentimental,
straightforward, intelligible way of Chaucer or of Shakespeare. The
mystical elements in Wordsworth's feeling for nature were foreign to
Browning's mind. An instructive comparison might be made between
Wordsworth's "Ode on Intimations of Immortality" and Browning's
"<a href="#Page_321">Prologue to Asolando</a>." The poems have the same starting point. Each one
attributes sadness to the poet's old age, and each gives as a cause of
the sadness the inevitable fading of the glory with which all nature was
invested to the eye of his youth. But here the resemblance ends.
Wordsworth believes that the youthful vision was a divine revelation to
be regained when the round of existence should be completed by a return
to his immortal home, and on the memory of that vision he founded his
faith in a future life. But Browning welcomed the loss of the vision.
Objects had been to him "palpably fire-clothed"; but with the loss of
"flame" there was a gain in reality. The vision had enthralled and
subjugated him; but with the sight of "a naked world" he had become
conscious of things as they are, and he rejoiced in a justness of
perception that declared what were to him the two great facts of life,
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> power and beauty of God, and the glory of the human soul. On these,
not on nature, he put his stress.</p>

<p>Browning's paramount interest in human nature is further illustrated by
his poems on the various arts. Of music, painting, and sculpture he has
written with the intimate and minute knowledge of a specialist in each
art. He is familiar with implements and materials, with the tricks of
the trade, the talk of the studios; but, after all, the art as an art is
of much less interest to him than is the worker. The process and even
the completed product are in Browning's view important only in so far as
they reveal or affect the artist, the musician, the sculptor, or some
phase of life. In such poems as "<a href="#Page_247">Abt Vogler</a>," "<a href="#Page_200">Fra Lippo Lippi</a>," "<a href="#Page_213">Andrea
del Sarto</a>," we are conscious not so much of music and pictures as of the
secret springs of failure, the divine despairs and discontents, the
aspirations, the creative ecstasies, of the men who wrought in these
realms. Andrea del Sarto's art is not the real theme of the poem bearing
his name. It is, rather, his character, of which his art is an
expression. The central fact of the poem is the recognition that a soul
morally impoverished cannot, even with well-nigh perfect technique,
produce great work, while, even with faulty technique, a setting of the
soul to grand issues will secure transcendent meanings. So, too, with
Abt Vogler. His music is not of the greatest, but our concern is with
the musician who, through the completeness of his spiritual absorption
in music, is conducted into a realm of experience beyond that of speech
or even of articulate thought.</p>

<p>Another distinctly human aspect of art interests Browning, and that is
its power to represent and so to recall a vanished civilization. Greek
statues, the devotional pictures of the early Florentines, the work of
the later Italian realists, stand, in "<a href="#Page_91">Old Pictures in Florence</a>," as
repre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>sentatives of the life and thought that produced them. In "<a href="#Page_88">A
Toccata of Galuppi's</a>" the music revivifies the superficial gaiety, the
undertone of fear, in the life of eighteenth century Venice. Highly
significant in this connection are the poems in which he traces the
evolution of art. Running through "<a href="#Page_91">Old Pictures in Florence</a>" and "<a href="#Page_200">Fra
Lippo Lippi</a>" we find an ordered statement of the chief changes in the
ideals of art as Browning saw them. The Greeks, we are told, had
produced in sculpture the most beautiful representations of the human
body. But if their successors had been content merely to admire this
perfect achievement, they would have purchased satisfaction at the price
of their own arrested development. Progress came only when, in the dawn
of Italian art, men turned from Greek perfection, from the supremely
beautiful but limited representations of the human body, to an attempt
to paint the invisible, the spiritual side of man's nature. The work of
these artists was great because it was not imitative and because it
stretched toward an unending and ideal future. But the idealistic and
aspiring temper of early Tuscan art had the defects of its qualities.
Its spiritual ecstasy once conventionalized and reduced to a formula led
to unreality, and, if not to untruth, at least to an unwholesome
ignoring of a part of truth. There was, therefore, an inevitable
reaction to the naturalism described with such verve and gusto by Fra
Lippo Lippi. But this is, after all, social history in terms of art, and
to Browning what has happened in painting is of value chiefly as showing
concretely what has happened in the mind of man.</p>

<p>From the instances already cited it is apparent that Browning's interest
centered, not in abstract or theoretical discussions of human problems,
but in the individuals who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> face the problems. In this point Browning is
sharply distinguished from his poetic contemporaries as a class. They
felt deeply "all the weary weight of this unintelligible world," so
deeply that while they gave much thought to ideals of social
amelioration, few of them presented individuals with any dramatic
distinctness. Browning stands practically by himself in the nineteenth
century as the poet who gives us both the "doubter and the doubt," who
is able to join with an impressive statement of the hopes and fears of
man, an equally impressive sequence of individual men and women. In this
he harks back to the broad inclusiveness of the Elizabethan dramatists.
In contemporary literature, his nearest congeners are in fiction, not in
poetry.</p>

<p>The great number and variety of Browning's characters can be illustrated
in different ways. We might, for instance, note how many nationalities
are represented. The personages in "Stafford" and the "<a href="#Page_69">Cavalier Tunes</a>"
are Englishmen from the time of the Civil War. "Clive" is a true story
of the Indian Empire. We have from Italian life the numerous characters
in <i>Sordello</i>, "<a href="#Page_200">Fra Lippo Lippi</a>," "Pictor Ignotus," "<a href="#Page_222">The Bishop Orders
His Tomb at St. Praxed's Church</a>," "<a href="#Page_135">My Last Duchess</a>," <i>The Ring and the
Book</i>, "<a href="#Page_183">A Grammarian's Funeral</a>," "<a href="#Page_84">Up at a Villa&mdash;Down in the City</a>," "In
a Gondola," and many more. "Count Gismond" and "<a href="#Page_282">Herv&eacute; Riel</a>" are French
stories. <i>Paracelsus</i> and "<a href="#Page_247">Abt Vogler</a>" are of German origin.
<i>Balaustion's Adventure</i>, <i>Aristophanes' Apology</i>, "<a href="#Page_295">Pheidippides</a>," and
"Echetlos" celebrate Greek thought and adventure. Very important poems
such as "<a href="#Page_105">Saul</a>" and "<a href="#Page_253">Rabbi Ben Ezra</a>," have to do with Jewish life. And
unlike Shakespeare, who is not concerned with making Julius C&aelig;sar a
Roman or Duke Theseus a Greek, Brown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>ing brings to the creation of each
of these widely divergent characters, a detailed knowledge of the
special habits of life and thought of the nation or race concerned. He
represents also many kinds of human interest. We find in his poems
seekers after knowledge such as Paracelsus, who takes all thought and
fact as his domain; or such as the Grammarian, who found Greek particles
too wide a realm; or such as the pedant Sibrandus Schafnaburgensis,
whose learned rubbish cumbers the land. There are likewise those who
grope after the truths of religion from Caliban on his island to the
learned physician Karshish and the highly cultured Cleon; those who have
the full vision from John to Rabbi Ben
<a name="corr1" id="corr1"></a><a class="correction" href="#cn1" title="changed from 'Erza'">Ezra</a>;
those who juggle with terms
and creeds as does Bishop Blougram; and out and out frauds like Sludge
the Medium. The church is represented by many men dissimilar in
endowments, tastes, spiritual experiences, and aims. There are Italian
prelates of every sort, from the worldly-minded Bishop of St. Praxed's,
occupied in death with vain thoughts of lapis-lazuli and pure Latin, to
the "soldier-saint," Caponsacchi, who saved Pompilia, and the wise old
Pope who pronounced Guido's doom; from the unworthy priest in the
Spanish Cloister to the very human, kindly Pope in "The Bean Feast." And
from all these it is far down the ages to the evangelical parish priest
of <i>The Inn Album</i>, that "purblind honest drudge," who, the deeper to
impress his flock, painted heaven dimly but "made hell distinct." There
are many artists, many musicians. There are poets from Aprile in
<i>Paracelsus</i>, and the troubadours Eglamour and Sordello, to Keats and
Shelley. The extremes of social life are given. There are the
street-girls in <i><a href="#Page_325">Pippa Passes</a></i> and there are kings and queens with royal
retinues. There are statesmen, and warriors, and seekers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> after romantic
adventure. There are haughty aristocrats of cold and cruel natures, and
there are obscure but high-hearted doers of heroic deeds. Browning's
dictum, "Study man, man, whatever the issue," led him into a world wider
than that known by any other poet of his time, and akin, as has been
pointed out, to that of the great writers of fiction. As an observer of
human life he was not unlike his poor poet of Valladolid who, with his
"scrutinizing hat," went about the streets, absorbed in watching all
kinds of people, all sorts of occupations, "scenting the world, looking
it full in the face." He chose to set forth "the wants and ways" of
actual life. He summed up his work in the "Epilogue to Pacchiarotto":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Man's thoughts and loves and hates!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth is my vineyard, these grew there:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From grape of the ground I made or marred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My vintage.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is further apparent that Browning's characters are never merely
types, but must always be reckoned with as individuals. It was his
belief that no two beings were ever made similar in head and heart;
hence, even where there are external similarities the essential elements
are strongly differentiated. Take, for instance, three poems in which
the situations are not unlike. In "<a href="#Page_135">My Last Duchess</a>," "<a href="#Page_152">The Flight of the
Duchess</a>," and <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, we have a portrayal of three men
of high lineage, but cold, egotistic, cruel, who have married very young
and lovely women over whom the custom of the times gives them absolute
power. But there the likeness ends. We cannot for a moment class
together the pol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>ished, aesthetic, well-bred aristocrat of the first
poem, the absurd little popinjay of the second, and the "tiger-cat" of
the third. Less strongly, but as clearly are the wives differentiated.
To the innocent gaiety of heart, the bright, sweet friendliness of the
hapless lady in "<a href="#Page_135">My Last Duchess</a>" must be added for the lady in "<a href="#Page_152">The
Flight of the Duchess</a>" a native force of character which, when roused by
the call of the gypsy-queen, enables her to break the yoke imposed on
her by the Duke and his mother and go forth into a life of adventure,
freedom, and love. The delicate, flower-like Pompilia in <i>The Ring and
the Book</i> has also power to initiate and carry through a plan of escape,
but her incentive is no call to romantic freedom. Her passive endurance
changes to active revolt only when motive and energy are supplied by her
love for her child. Or take Pippa and Phene in <i><a href="#Page_325">Pippa Passes</a></i>, two
beautiful young girls brought up in dangerous and evil surroundings, but
both innately pure. In character and experience they are, however, as
unlike as two girls could be. Phene, undeveloped in mind and heart, the
easily duped agent of a cruel trick, appeals to us by her slow,
incredulous, but eager response to goodness and aspiration, the
tremulous opening of her soul to love. But Pippa, with her observant
love of nature, her gay, sportive, winsome fancies, her imaginative
sympathy with the lives of others, her knowledge of good and evil, her
poise, her bright steadiness of soul, carries us into a different and
much more highly evolved world of thought and feeling. So we might go
through the great assemblage of Browning's characters to find that each
one stands out by himself as a person with his own qualities,
possibilities, and problems.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>In all this portrayal of individuals the emphasis is on things of the
mind and heart. In these realms Browning found nothing alien or
uninteresting. From point to point his poetry illustrates what he said
in his comment on <i>Sordello</i>, "My stress lay on the incidents in the
development of a human soul; little else is worth study." In all his
poetry environment is of importance only in so far as it is the stuff on
which the soul works. It is "the subtle thing called spirit," it is "the
soul's world" to which he devotes himself.</p>

<p>It is only from a study of Browning's many characters that we may arrive
at a statement of some of the distinguishing features of his philosophy
of life. And any such statements must be made with extreme caution
because of his dramatic method. He utters this caution himself when he
says of his poems, "Their contents are always dramatic in principle, and
so many utterances of so many imaginary people." Yet it is possible, by
taking the general trend and scope of his work, to make justifiable
deductions concerning the dominant ideas in the rich field of his poetry
and drama.</p>

<p>In Browning's philosophy of life, words of especial significance are
"growth" and "progress." Domizia in <i>Luria</i> says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How inexhaustibly the spirit grows!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One object, she seemed erewhile born to reach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her whole energies and die content&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So like a wall at the world's edge is stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With naught beyond to live for&mdash;is that reached?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already are new undreamed energies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outgrowing under, and extending farther<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a new object.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></div></div>

<p>So, too, John in "A Death in the Desert" sums up his belief in the line,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I say that man was made to grow, not stop.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Growth here and growth hereafter are the essential elements of
Browning's creed. And there is no other poet in whom all kinds of
thinking and doing are so uniformly tested by their outcome in the
growth of the soul. Does joy stimulate to fuller life; does suffering
bring out moral qualities; do obstacles develop energy; do sharp
temptations become a source of strength and assured soldiership; does
knowledge of evil lead to a new exaltation of good; does sin lead to
self-knowledge and so to regeneration? Then all these are ministers of
grace, for through them the soul has reached greater heights and fuller
life. Whatever bids the soul "nor stand nor sit, but go" is to be
welcomed. The cost of this growth may be great, but the advances of
spirit are represented as worth any sacrifice. The lady in "<a href="#Page_152">The Flight
of the Duchess</a>" goes from splendor and ease to hardship and obscurity,
but she wins freedom of thought and of act and the opportunity to test
the qualities of her soul. In <i><a href="#Page_325">Pippa Passes</a></i> Sebald might have had love
and wealth, Jules might have attained fame along the conventional path
marked out for him by the Monsignor, Luigi had the prospect of an easy
life and happy love, the Monsignor might have had enhanced honor from
the church into whose coffers he could have turned great revenues. But
instead each responds in turn to Pippa's songs; Sebald gains a true view
of sin, Jules gets a new conception of service and attainment, Luigi's
wavering purpose of self-sacrifice for his country's good is
strengthened, the Monsignor is held back from connivance at a crime. In
all these cases the external loss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> is as nothing compared to the gain in
spiritual knowledge and energy.</p>

<p>Contact with magnetic and superior personalities is a way of growth
particularly noted by Browning. There are men, he says, who bring new
feeling fresh from God, and whose life "reteaches us what life should
be, what faith is, loyalty and simpleness." Pompilia says of
Caponsacchi:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Through such souls alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God stooping shows sufficient of his light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For us i' the dark to rise by.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The highest souls are "seers" in the noblest sense and they "impart the
gift of seeing to the rest." But the helpful personality need not be
great in knowledge or rank. In Pippa Browning emphasizes the power of
unconscious goodness in clarifying the spiritual vision of others and in
thus stimulating to right action. And in David he shows the power of
poetic charm, innocence, and eager love to drive away from another heart
a mood of black despair.</p>

<p>But outside influences are, after all, says Browning, of secondary
importance. They can, at best, do no more than stimulate and guide. When
Andrea del Sarto attributes his general lowering of ideals and power to
the influence of Lucrezia, he evades the real issue. Incentives must
come from the soul's self. Growth is dependent on personal struggle. Man
is, by his very nature,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">forced to try and make, else fail to grow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Formed to rise, reach at, if not grasp and gain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good beyond him&mdash;which attempt is growth.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></div></div>

<p>So, also, is it better that youth</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">should strive, through acts uncouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward making, than repose on aught found made.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is in the independence and originality of such striving that the soul
discovers and frees its innate potentialities.</p>

<p>An inevitable corollary of this idea of progress is the emphasis put
upon aspiration as a habit of the mind. The pursuit of an ideal, a
divine discontent with present accomplishment, are enjoined upon man.
The gleams of heaven on earth are not meant to be permanent or
satisfying, but only to sting man into hunger for full light. When a
human being has achieved to the full extent of his perceptions or
aspirations, he has, thinks Browning, met with the greatest possible
disaster, that of arrested development. Man's powers should ever climb
new heights. For his soul's health he should always see "a flying point
of bliss remote, a happiness in store afar, a sphere of distant glory."
"A man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?"
According to this ideal, man's conception of good is ever changing and
ever widening and hence never in this life to be fully attained; yet the
condition of growth is that he have an unmeasured thirst for good and
that he pursue it with unquenchable ardor.</p>

<p>The importance of love as one of the most effective agencies in
spiritual growth is stated and restated in Browning's poetry and by
exceedingly diverse characters. The Queen in <i>In a Balcony</i> turns away
from her lonely splendor to exclaim,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is no good of life but love&mdash;but love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What else looks good is some shade flung from love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love gilds it, gives it worth.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The Duchess learns from the gypsy</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How love is the only good in the world.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The famous singer in "Dis Aliter Visum" knows that art, verse, music,
count as naught beside "love found, gained, and kept." Browning seems to
regard almost any genuine love as a means of opening out the nature to
fuller self-knowledge, to wider sympathies, and to increased power of
action. Hence he condemns all cautious calculation of obstacles, all
dwelling upon conventional difficulties, in the path of those who have
clearly seen "the love-way." Hence even love unrequited is counted of
inestimable value. In <i>Colombe's Birthday</i> Valence says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Is the knowledge of her, naught? the memory, naught?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Lady, should such an one have looked on you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne'er wrong yourself so far as quote the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And say, love can go unrequited here!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will have blessed him to his whole life's end&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low passions hindered, baser cares kept back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All goodness cherished where you dwelt&mdash;and dwell.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the love of man and woman is not the only sort. A part of the value
of this individual relationship is that it may be regarded as a
revelation and symbol of the spirit of all-embracing sympathy whereby
mankind should be ruled. When Paracelsus analyzes his life he ascribes
his failure to the fact that he has sought knowledge to the exclusion of
all else; he finally came to see that knowledge, however profound, is of
itself barren of satisfaction. He had meant to serve men by revealing
truth to them, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> he found that real service is based on the
understanding given by love. In self condemnation he says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In my own heart love had not been made wise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To trace love's faint beginnings in mankind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To know even hate is but a mask of love's.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see a good in evil, and a hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ill-success; to sympathize, be proud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their half-reasons, faint aspirings, dim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struggles for truth, their poorest fallacies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their prejudice and fears and cares and doubts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All with a touch of nobleness, despite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their error, upward tending all though weak.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Browning's conception of the function and power of love is based on his
belief in its divine origin. Twice at least, in "Easter Day" and "<a href="#Page_105">Saul</a>,"
his characters work out from an overpowering recognition of God's
omniscience and omnipotence to a final recognition that his love is
equal in scope with his power and knowledge. And he counts human service
as most complete when, as in David before Saul, it reaches out to God's
love and recruits its failing forces from the divine source.</p>

<p>Underlying Browning's doctrine of the value of love, and his doctrine of
progress and aspiration, is his belief in personal immortality. When he
was charged with being strongly against Darwin, with rejecting the
truths of science and regretting its advance, he answered that the idea
of a progressive development from senseless matter until man's
appearance had been a familiar conception to him from the beginning, but
he reiterated his constant faith in creative intelligence acting on
matter but not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> resulting from it. "Soul," he said, "is not matter, nor
from matter, but above." Two assumptions which though not susceptible of
proof he regards as "inescapable," are the existence of creative
intelligence and of "the subtle thing called spirit." When he argues out
the question of the immortality of this spirit, as in <i>La Saisiaz</i>, he
admits the subjective character of the evidence; but when he speaks
spontaneously out of his own feeling or experience, it is with positive
belief in life after death. To Mr. Sharp he said, "Death, death! It is
this harping on death that I do despise so much! Why, <i>amico mio</i>, you
know as well as I that death is life, just as our daily, our momentarily
dying body is none the less alive and ever recruiting new forces of
existence. Without death which is our crape-like church-yardy word for
change, for growth, there could be no prolongation of what we call life.
Pshaw, it is foolish to argue upon such a thing, even. For myself, I
deny death as an end of everything. Never say of me that I am dead!"
When his wife died he wrote in her Testament these words from Dante,
"Thus I believe, thus I affirm, thus I am certain it is, that from this
life I shall pass to another better there where that lady lives of whom
my soul was enamored." This faith in life after death explains much of
Browning's philosophy. The source of the pagan Cleon's profound
discouragement was the fact that man should be dowered with
"joy-hunger," should be given the ability to perceive and comprehend
splendor and breadth of experience, but should, through the straitness
of human limitations, be held back from satisfaction and achievement,
and should be left to die thus dazzled, thus baffled. The secret of
Browning's optimism, on the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> hand, is his belief that in heaven
the soul is freed from limitations, and blossoms out into capabilities
of joy and of activity beyond anything suggested by the most golden
dreams of earth. To him all life is a unit, beginning here and destined
to unimaginable development hereafter. Earth is regarded as a place of
tutelage where man may learn to set foot on some one path to heaven. And
no work begun here shall ever pause for death. Even apparent failure
here counts for little so the quest be not abandoned. Each of us may, as
Abt Vogler, look without despair on the broken arcs of earth if his
faith reveals the perfect round in heaven.</p>

<p>From any prolonged study of Browning's poetry we become conscious of
certain dominant qualities of style that may be thought of quite apart
from his themes or message. That his style has the defect of its
qualities has already been pointed out. Here we may appropriately
indicate those qualities as positive elements of his power. His diction,
rich alike in the most learned words and the most colloquial, is
responsive to all demands. His power of phrasing runs the whole gamut
from the most pellucid simplicity to the most triumphant originality.
His figures of speech, drawn from all realms, are penetrating in
quality, of startling aptness. Equally characteristic is his
versification, varying as it does from passages of melodic smoothness
and grace to lines as strident, broken, and harsh as the thought they
dramatically reflect. In narration, whether in the brilliant rapidity
and ease of a short poem like "<a href="#Page_282">Herv&eacute; Riel</a>" or in the sustained flow of a
long story like that of Pompilia, we find unusual skill. In
disquisition, in the presentation of complicated and elusive
intellectual processes, there is a quite un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>matched agility and
dexterity. Probably no two forms of poetry contain more of Browning's
most noteworthy work than the lyric, especially the reflective love
lyric, and that form which is distinctively his own, the dramatic
monologue. In his best poems in this last form he has no competitor. It
is in the presentation of character through the medium of dramatic
monologue that he most fully reveals the unerring precision of his
analysis, his lightning glance into the heart of a mystery, the ease
with which he tracks a motive or mood or thought to its last hiding
place, and his consequent passion and fire of sympathy or scorn.</p>

<p>Finally, whether we consider Browning's style or subject matter or
philosophy of life, we become growingly conscious of his force. The
"clear Virgilian line" of Tennyson is the outcome of a nature
instinctively aristocratic and aloof. Browning is out in the thick of
the fight and almost vociferously demands a hearing. Whatever makes his
thought clear, vivid, active, forcible, seems to him, however prosaic it
may appear at first glance, proper poetic material. The immediate effect
of his verse is the rousing of the mind to great issues. His tremendous
sincerity results in a dispelling of mists, a stripping off of husks.
His demand for the truth is a trumpet note of challenge to our doubt or
fear or indifference. His penetrating study of human problems leads to
an inevitable widening of the horizon of comprehension and sympathy on
the part of his readers. And his courage and optimism constitute an
inspiration and stimulus of an uncommonly virile sort.</p>

<p>It has been said that Browning is "not a poet, but a literature," and in
work so vast and varied that it can be thus characterized there must be
wide extremes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> value. It is almost certain that portions of his work
cannot live. They are too difficult, too unliterary. But in the portions
where great thought finds adequate form, the product is a priceless gift
and one not equaled by any other poet of his age.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The
first production of <i><a href="#Page_325">Pippa Passes</a></i> was given in Copley
Hall, Boston, in 1899, with an arrangement in six scenes by Miss Helen
A. Clarke. <i>The Return of the Druses</i> was arranged and presented by Miss
Charlotte Porter in 1902 and was a dramatic success. <i>A Blot in the
'Scutcheon</i> was brought out by Macready, with Phelps in the chief part
and with Miss Helen Faucit as Mildred. It was played to crowded houses
and received much applause. It was revived by Phelps at Sadler's Wells
in 1848; and by the Browning Society in 1885 at St. George's Hall,
London. In the winter of that year the play was given in Washington by
Lawrence Barrett. It has also within a few years been admirably
presented by Mrs. Lemoyne in New York and elsewhere. <i>Colombe's
Birthday</i>, which was published in 1844, was not put upon the stage till
1853, when it was performed at the Haymarket Theater in London with Lady
Martin (Helen Faucit) as Colombe. It was performed in Boston in 1854 and
enthusiastically received. It was revived in 1885 with Miss Alma Murray
as Colombe, when it was commented on as being "charming on the boards,
clearer, more direct in action, more picturesque, more full of delicate
surprises than one imagines it in print." It was also successfully
produced at McVicker's Theater, Chicago, in November, 1894, with Miss
Marlowe as Colombe.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> An interesting corroboration of Mrs. Browning's words is
found in the fact that the 1868 edition of Browning's works, by Smith
Elder and Co., was reprinted as Numbers 1-19 of the <i>Official Guide of
the Chicago and Alton R. R., and Monthly Reprint and Advertiser</i>, edited
by Mr. James Charlton. A copy is in the British Museum. The reprint
appeared in 1872-1874. See Mrs. Orr's bibliography.</p></div>

in the autumn of 1900. Mrs. Lemoyne was the Queen, Otis Skinner was

<h2><a name="BIBLIOGRAPHY" id="BIBLIOGRAPHY"></a>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>


<p>The great number of books and articles on Browning and his work is shown
by the Bibliography of Biography and Criticism prepared by John P.
Anderson of the British Museum and printed in William Sharp's <i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/656">Life of
Robert Browning</a></i>. The selection to be given here can hardly more than
suggest this large amount of material.</p>

<p>The 1888-9 edition of Browning's <i>Works</i> by Smith, Elder and Company
incorporates Browning's last revisions and his own punctuation. The
Macmillan edition in nine volumes in 1894 reproduces this text.</p>

<p>For biographical material important books are:</p>

<p><i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16182">The Letters of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett 1845-1846</a></i>, two
volumes, 1902, Harper Brothers.</p>

<p><i>The Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Edited with Biographical
Additions by Frederic G. Kenyon.</i> Macmillan, 1897. (Two volumes in one,
1899.)</p>

<p><i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/655">The Life and Letters of Robert Browning</a></i> by Mrs. A. Sutherland Orr in
1891. A new edition, revised and in part rewritten by Mr. Frederick G.
Kenyon, was brought out by Houghton, Mifflin and Company in 1908. Mrs.
Orr and Mr. Kenyon were both friends of Browning and could speak with
authority on many details of his life.</p>

<p><i>Robert Browning, Personalia</i>, by Edmund Gosse. Houghton Mifflin and
Company, 1890. This book consists of a reprint of two articles, one from
<i>The Century Magazine</i> on "The Early Career of Robert Browning," and one
from <i>The New Review</i> entitled "Personal Impressions." These articles
are of exceptional interest because Mr. Gosse lived near Mr. Browning at
Warwick Crescent and they were on terms of close friendship. In
<i>Critical Kit-Kats</i>, 1896, Mr. Gosse gives the story of <i>Sonnets from
the Portuguese</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span><i>Robert Browning.</i> In <i>Bookman Biographies</i>, edited by W. Robertson
Nicholl. Hodder and Stoughton, London. Many interesting illustrations.</p>

<p><i>The Century Magazine</i> for 1900 and 1902 gives Mrs. Bronson's account of
Browning at Asolo and at Venice.</p>

<p>For general handbooks see:</p>

<p><i>The Browning Cyclop&aelig;dia.</i> Edward Berdoe, Macmillan, 1902. Elaborate
analysis of each poem. Many textual notes. Interpretations often
involved and far-fetched to the point of being untenable.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14498">Handbook of Robert Browning's Works</a>.</i> Mrs. A. Sutherland Orr. First
edition, 1885; sixth edition, 1891. Republished by Bell and Sons,
London, 1902. Explanatory analysis of each poem. Edition of 1902
contains complete bibliography of Browning's works. Written at the
request of the London Browning Society.</p>

<p>For criticism see, as books varying widely in point of view and scope,
but each of distinct interest:</p>

<p><i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/260">An Introduction to the Study of Robert Browning's Poetry</a>.</i> Hiram
Corson. Boston, 1886.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/17608">An Introduction to the Study of Browning</a>.</i> Arthur Symons. London,
Cassell and Company, 1886.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14476">Life of Robert Browning</a>.</i> William Sharp. Walter Scott and Company,
London, 1897.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14316">The Poetry of Robert Browning</a>.</i> Stopford A. Brooke. Crowell and
Company, 1902.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13342">Robert Browning</a>.</i> G. K. Chesterton. Macmillan, 1903.</p>

<p><i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14618">Robert Browning</a>.</i> C. H. Herford. Dodd, Mead and Company, 1905.</p>

<p><i>Interpretations of Poetry and Religion</i>, by George Santayana,
Scribners, 1900, contains an interesting presentation of Browning's work
in a chapter entitled "The Poetry of Barbarism."</p>

<p><i>Browning Study Programmes</i> by Charlotte Porter and Helen A. Clarke,
Crowell and Company, 1900, is a series of studies on separate poems or
on groups of poems.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> Often very suggestive and helpful. In <i>Poet-Lore</i>,
edited by Miss Clarke and Miss Porter, are, <i>passim</i>, many other
valuable studies and notes on Browning. The Camberwell edition of
Browning's poems, edited by Miss Clarke and Miss Porter with excellent
annotations, was published by Crowell and Company in 1898.</p>

<p><i>The London Browning Society's Papers</i> and <i>The Boston Browning
Society's Papers</i> contain much valuable material on separate poems or on
various phases of Browning's life and work.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Over the sea our galleys went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cleaving prows in order brave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a speeding wind and a bounding wave&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span><span class="i1">A gallant armament;<span class='linenum'>20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each bark built out of a forest-tree<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Left leafy and rough as first it grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nailed all over the gaping sides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within and without, with black bull-hides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seethed in fat and suppled in flame,<span class='linenum'>25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear the playful billows' game.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So each good ship was rude to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rude and bare to the outward view,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But each upbore a stately tent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where cedar pales in scented row<span class='linenum'>30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept out the flakes of the dancing brine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And an awning drooped the mast below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fold on fold of the purple fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That neither noontide nor starshine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor moonlight cold which maketh mad,<span class='linenum'>35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Might pierce the regal tenement.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sun dawned, oh, gay and glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We set the sail and plied the oar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the night-wind blew like breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For joy of one day's voyage more,<span class='linenum'>40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We sang together on the wide sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like men at peace on a peaceful shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each sail was loosed to the wind so free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each helm made sure by the twilight star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a sleep as calm as death,<span class='linenum'>45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We, the voyagers from afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lay stretched along, each weary crew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a circle round its wondrous tent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence gleamed soft light and curled rich scent,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And with light and perfume, music too.<span class='linenum'>50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the stars wheeled round, and the darkness passed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,<span class='linenum'>5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into the midnight we galloped abreast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right,<span class='linenum'>10</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the half-chime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Joris broke silence with, "Yet there is time!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At Aershot up leaped of a sudden the sun,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To stare through the mist at us galloping past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back<span class='linenum'>25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one eye's black intelligence&mdash;ever that glance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the thick, heavy spume-flakes which aye and anon<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By Hasselt Dirck groaned; and cried Joris, "Stay spur!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then I cast loose my buffcoat, each holster let fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all,<span class='linenum'>50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called my Roland his pet-name, my horse without peer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And all I remember is&mdash;friends flocking round<span class='linenum'>55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I sat with his head 'twixt my knees on the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Had I but plenty of money, money enough and to spare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The house for me, no doubt, were a house in the city-square;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, such a life, such a life, as one leads at the window there!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Something to see, by Bacchus, something to hear, at least!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, the whole day long, one's life is a perfect feast;<span class='linenum'>5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">While up at a villa one lives, I maintain it, no more than a beast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well now, look at our villa! stuck like the horn of a bull<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just on a mountain-edge as bare as the creature's skull,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save a mere shag of a bush with hardly a leaf to pull!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But the city, oh, the city&mdash;the square with the houses! Why?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are stone-faced, white as a curd, there's something to take the eye!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Houses in four straight lines, not a single front awry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You watch who crosses and gossips, who saunters, who hurries by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green blinds, as a matter of course, to draw when the sun gets high;<span class='linenum'>15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the shops with fanciful signs which are painted properly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">What of a villa? Though winter be over in March by rights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis May perhaps ere the snow shall have withered well off the heights:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The wild tulip, at end of its tube, blows out its great red bell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a thin clear bubble of blood, for the children to pick and sell.<span class='linenum'>25</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Is it ever hot in the square? There's a fountain to spout and splash!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the shade it sings and springs; in the shine such foam-bows flash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the horses with curling fish-tails, that prance and paddle and pash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round the lady atop in her conch&mdash;fifty gazers do not abash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though all that she wears is some weeds round her waist in a sort of sash.<span class='linenum'>30</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All the year long at the villa, nothing to see though you linger,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some think fireflies pretty when they mix i' the corn and mingle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or thrid the stinking hemp till the stalks of it seem a-tingle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Late August or early September, the stunning cicala is shrill,<span class='linenum'>35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bees keep their tiresome whine round the resinous firs on the hill.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ere you open your eyes in the city, the blessed church-bells begin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sooner the bells leave off than the diligence rattles in;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You get the pick of the news, and it costs you never a pin.<span class='linenum'>40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">By and by there's the traveling doctor gives pills, lets blood, draws teeth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the Pulcinello-trumpet breaks up the market beneath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the post office such a scene-picture&mdash;the new play, piping hot!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a notice how, only this morning, three liberal thieves were shot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above it, behold the Archbishop's most fatherly of rebukes,<span class='linenum'>45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beneath, with his crown and his lion, some little new law of the Duke's!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or a sonnet with flowery marge, to the Reverend Don So-and-so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarca, Saint Jerome, and Cicero;<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Bang-whang-whang</i> goes the drum, <i>tootle-te-tootle</i> the fife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No keeping one's haunches still; it's the greatest pleasure in life.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But bless you, it's dear&mdash;it's dear! fowls, wine, at double the rate.<span class='linenum'>55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have clapped a new tax upon salt, and what oil pays passing the gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's a horror to think of. And so the villa for me, not the city!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beggars can scarcely be choosers; but still&mdash;ah, the pity, the pity!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look, two and two go the priests, then the monks with cowls and sandals,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the penitents dressed in white shirts, a-holding the yellow candles;<span class='linenum'>60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">One, he carries a flag up straight, and another a cross with handles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Duke's guard brings up the rear, for the better prevention of scandals;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Bang-whang-whang</i> goes the drum, <i>tootle-te-tootle</i> the fife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, a day in the city-square, there is no such pleasure in life!<br /></span>

<h2>MY LAST DUCHESS</h2>
<h3>FERRARA</h3>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That's my last Duchess painted on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking as if she were alive.   I call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That piece a wonder, now: Fr&agrave; Pandolf's hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worked busily a day, and there she stands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will't please you sit and look at her? I said<span class='linenum'>5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Fr&agrave; Pandolf" by design, for never read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strangers like you that pictured countenance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The depth and passion of its earnest glance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to myself they turned (since none puts by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)<span class='linenum'>10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How such a glance came there; so, not the first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, 'twas not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her husband's presence only, called that spot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of joy into the Duchess' cheek; perhaps<span class='linenum'>15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fr&agrave; Pandolf chanced to say, "Her mantle laps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over my lady's wrist too much," or "Paint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must never hope to reproduce the faint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half-flush that dies along her throat"; such stuff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough<span class='linenum'>20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For calling up that spot of joy. She had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A heart&mdash;how shall I say?&mdash;too soon made glad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too easily impressed; she liked whate'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir, 'twas all one! My favor at her breast,<span class='linenum'>25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dropping of the daylight in the West,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bough of cherries some officious fool<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She rode with round the terrace&mdash;all and each<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would draw from her alike the approving speech,<span class='linenum'>30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or blush, at least. She thanked men&mdash;good! but thanked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somehow&mdash;I know not how&mdash;as if she ranked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With anybody's gift. Who'd stoop to blame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This sort of trifling? Even had you skill<span class='linenum'>35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In speech&mdash;(which I have not)&mdash;to make your will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quite clear to such an one, and say, "Just this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or there exceed the mark"&mdash;and if she let<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set<span class='linenum'>40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;E'en then would be some stooping; and I choose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never to stoop. Oh, sir, she smiled, no doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;<span class='linenum'>45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if alive. Will't please you rise? We'll meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The company below, then. I repeat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Count your master's known munificence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is ample warrant that no just pretense<span class='linenum'>50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though his fair daughter's self, as I avowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At starting, is my object. Nay, we'll go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,<span class='linenum'>55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!<br /></span>

<h2>THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN;</h2>
<h3>A CHILD'S STORY</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hamelin Town's in Brunswick,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By famous Hanover city;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The river Weser, deep and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Washes its wall on the southern side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pleasanter spot you never spied;<span class='linenum'>5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">But when begins my ditty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Almost five hundred years ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see the townsfolk suffer so<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From vermin was a pity.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rats!<span class='linenum'>10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fought the dogs and killed the cats,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And bit the babies in the cradles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ate the cheeses out of the vats,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And licked the soup from the cooks' own ladles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Split open the kegs of salted sprats,<span class='linenum'>15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even spoiled the women's chats<br /></span>
<span class="i3">By drowning their speaking<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With shrieking and squeaking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fifty different sharps and flats.<span class='linenum'>20</span><br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last the people in a body<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To the Town Hall came flocking:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis clear," cried they, "our Mayor's a noddy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as for our Corporation&mdash;shocking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think we buy gowns lined with ermine<span class='linenum'>25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For dolts that can't or won't determine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What's best to rid us of our vermin!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You hope, because you're old and obese,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find in the furry civic robe ease?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rouse up, sirs! Give your brains a racking<span class='linenum'>30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find the remedy we're lacking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this the Mayor and Corporation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quaked with a mighty consternation.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An hour they sat in council;<span class='linenum'>35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">At length the Mayor broke silence:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I wish I were a mile hence!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's easy to bid one rack one's brain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm sure my poor head aches again,<span class='linenum'>40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've scratched it so, and all in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, for a trap, a trap, a trap!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as he said this, what should hap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the chamber door but a gentle tap?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Bless us," cried the Mayor, "what's that?"<span class='linenum'>45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(With the Corporation as he sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking little though wondrous fat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor brighter was his eye, nor moister<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than a too-long-opened oyster,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span><span class="i0">Save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous<span class='linenum'>50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a plate of turtle green and glutinous)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Only a scraping of shoes on the mat?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anything like the sound of a rat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes my heart go pit-a-pat!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come in!"&mdash;the Mayor cried, looking bigger&mdash;<span class='linenum'>55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in did come the strangest figure!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His queer long coat from heel to head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was half of yellow and half of red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he himself was tall and thin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,<span class='linenum'>60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lips where smiles went out and in;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no guessing his kith and kin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nobody could enough admire<span class='linenum'>65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tall man and his quaint attire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth one: "It's as my great-grandsire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Starting up at the Trump of Doom's tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had walked this way from his painted tombstone!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He advanced to the council-table:<span class='linenum'>70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, "Please your honors," said he, "I'm able,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By means of a secret charm, to draw<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All creatures living beneath the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That creep or swim or fly or run,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span><span class="i0">After me so as you never saw!<span class='linenum'>75</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I chiefly use my charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On creatures that do people harm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mole and toad and newt and viper;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And people call me the Pied Piper."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And here they noticed round his neck<span class='linenum'>80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">A scarf of red and yellow stripe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To match with his coat of the self-same check;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And at the scarf's end hung a pipe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if impatient to be playing<span class='linenum'>85</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon this pipe, as low it dangled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over his vesture so old-fangled.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yet," said he, "poor piper as I am,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Tartary I freed the Cham,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Last June, from his huge swarms of gnats;<span class='linenum'>90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I eased in Asia the Nizam<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of a monstrous brood of vampire-bats:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as for what your brain bewilders,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">If I can rid your town of rats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will you give me a thousand guilders?"<span class='linenum'>95</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"One? fifty thousand!"&mdash;was the exclamation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Into the street the Piper stepped,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Smiling first a little smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if he knew what magic slept<span class='linenum'>100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">In his quiet pipe the while;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, like a musical adept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;<span class='linenum'>105</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You heard as if an army muttered;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the muttering grew to a grumbling;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.<span class='linenum'>110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,<span class='linenum'>115</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Families by tens and dozens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed the Piper for their lives.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From street to street he piped advancing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And step for step they followed dancing,<span class='linenum'>120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until they came to the river Weser,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wherein all plunged and perished!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Save one who, stout as Julius C&aelig;sar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swam across and lived to carry<br /></span>
<span class="i1">(As he, the manuscript he cherished)<span class='linenum'>125</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Rat-land home his commentary:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was, "At the first shrill notes of the pipe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard a sound as of scraping tripe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And putting apples, wondrous ripe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a cider-press's gripe:<span class='linenum'>130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it seemed as if a voice<span class='linenum'>135</span><br /></span>
<span class="i3">(Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is breathed) called out, 'O rats, rejoice!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!'<span class='linenum'>140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And just as a bulky sugar-puncheon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All ready staved, like a great sun shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glorious scarce an inch before me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as methought it said, 'Come, bore me!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;I found the Weser rolling o'er me."<span class='linenum'>145</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">You should have heard the Hamelin people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Never gave the enraptured air)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little hands clapping and little tongues chattering,<span class='linenum'>200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like fowls in a farm-yard when barley is scattering,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Unable to move a step, or cry<span class='linenum'>210</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">As the Piper turned from the High Street<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where the Weser rolled its waters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right in the way of their sons and daughters!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However he turned from South to West,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The door in the mountain-side shut fast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did I say, all? No! One was lame,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My lame foot would be speedily cured,<span class='linenum'>250</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The music stopped and I stood still,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That's one vast red drear burnt-up plain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till at the last, for a bounding belt,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">To show the people, and while they passed<span class='linenum'>50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wondrous bantling round about,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Was first to start at the outside blast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the Kaiser's courier blew his horn,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"And," quoth the Kaiser's courier, "since<span class='linenum'>55</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Duke looked down and seemed to wince,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But he thought of wars o'er the world wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Castles a-fire, men on their march,<span class='linenum'>60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The toppling tower, the crashing arch;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And up he looked, and awhile he eyed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The row of crests and shields and banners<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all achievements after all manners,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And "aye," said the Duke with a surly pride.<span class='linenum'>65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">The more was his comfort when he died<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In a silken shoe for a leather boot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Petticoated like a herald,<span class='linenum'>70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">In a chamber next to an ante-room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where he breathed the breath of page and groom,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What he called stink, and they, perfume:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;They should have set him on red Berold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mad with pride, like fire to manage!<span class='linenum'>75</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They should have got his cheek fresh tannage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such a day as today in the merry sunshine!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">(Hark, the wind's on the heath at its game!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, for a noble falcon-lanner<span class='linenum'>80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To flap each broad wing like a banner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turn in the wind, and dance like flame!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had they broached a white-beer cask from Berlin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Or if you incline to prescribe mere wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put to his lips, when they saw him pine,<span class='linenum'>85</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cup of our own Moldavia fine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So, at home, the sick, tall, yellow Duchess<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Our rough North land was the Land of Lays,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He revived all usages thoroughly worn-out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The souls of them fumed-forth, the hearts of them torn-out:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chief in the chase his neck he periled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a lathy horse, all legs and length,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blood for bone, all speed, no strength;<span class='linenum'>120</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">And out of a convent, at the word,<span class='linenum'>125</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came the lady in time of spring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Oh, old thoughts they cling, they cling!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That day, I know, with a dozen oaths<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I clad myself in thick hunting-clothes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fit for the chase of urochs or buffle<span class='linenum'>130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In winter-time when you need to muffle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the Duke had a mind we should cut a figure,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And so we saw the lady arrive:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My friend, I have seen a white crane bigger!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She was the smallest lady alive,<span class='linenum'>135</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made in a piece of nature's madness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too small, almost, for the life and gladness<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That overfilled her, as some hive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the bears' reach on the high trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is crowded with its safe, merry bees:<span class='linenum'>140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In truth, she was not hard to please!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up she looked, down she looked, round at the mead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight at the castle, that's best indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To look at from outside the walls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for us, styled the "serfs and thralls,"<span class='linenum'>145</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She as much thanked me as if she had said it,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">(With her eyes, do you understand?)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I patted her horse while I led it;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Max, who rode on her other hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said, no bird flew past but she inquired<span class='linenum'>150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What its true name was, nor ever seemed tired&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If that was an eagle she saw hover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the green and gray bird on the field was the plover.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When suddenly appeared the Duke:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And as down she sprung, the small foot pointed<span class='linenum'>155</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On to my hand&mdash;as with a rebuke,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And as if his backbone were not jointed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Duke stepped rather aside than forward,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And welcomed her with his grandest smile;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">And, mind you, his mother all the while<span class='linenum'>160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chilled in the rear, like a wind to Nor'ward;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up, like a weary yawn, with its pulleys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went, in a shriek, the rusty portcullis;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like a glad sky the north-wind sullies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lady's face stopped its play,<span class='linenum'>165</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if her first hair had grown gray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For such things must begin some one day.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In a day or two she was well again;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">This in his station, and that in his office,<span class='linenum'>185</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Duke's plan admitted a wife, at most,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To meet his eye, with the other trophies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now outside the hall, now in it,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To hear the consummate self-satisfaction<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With which the young Duke and the old dame<span class='linenum'>195</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would let her advise, and criticize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, being a fool, instruct the wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And, child-like, parcel out praise or blame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bore it all in complacent guise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though an artificer, after contriving<span class='linenum'>200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wheel-work image as if it were living,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should find with delight it could motion to strike him!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So found the Duke, and his mother like him:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lady hardly got a rebuff&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That had not been contemptuous enough,<span class='linenum'>205</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his cursed smirk, as he nodded applause,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And duly acknowledged the Duke's forethought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But spoke of her health, if her health were worth aught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the weight by day and the watch by night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And much wrong now that used to be right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, thanking him, declined the hunting&mdash;<span class='linenum'>290</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was conduct ever more affronting?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the ceremony settled&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With the towel ready, and the sewer<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Polishing up his oldest ewer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the jennet pitched upon, a piebald,<span class='linenum'>295</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Black-barred, cream-coated, and pink eye-balled&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No wonder if the Duke was nettled!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when she persisted nevertheless&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, I suppose here's the time to confess<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That there ran half round our lady's chamber<span class='linenum'>300</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A balcony none of the hardest to clamber;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that Jacynth, the tire-woman, ready in waiting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stayed in call outside, what need of relating?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since Jacynth was like a June rose, why, a fervent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adorer of Jacynth of course was your servant;<span class='linenum'>305</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if she had the habit to peep through the casement,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How could I keep at any vast distance?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And so, as I say, on the lady's persistence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Duke, dumb-stricken with amazement,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood for a while in a sultry smother,<span class='linenum'>310</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">And then, with a smile that partook of the awful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned her over to his yellow mother<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To learn what was held decorous and lawful;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the mother smelt blood with a cat-like instinct,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As her cheek quick whitened through all its quince-tinct.<span class='linenum'>315</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, but the lady heard the whole truth at once!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What meant she?&mdash;Who was she?&mdash;Her duty and station,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wisdom of age and the folly of youth, at once,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Its decent regard and its fitting relation&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In brief, my friend, set all the devils in hell free<span class='linenum'>320</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turn them out to carouse in a belfry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And treat the priests to a fifty-part canon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then you may guess how that tongue of hers ran on!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, somehow or other it ended at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, licking her whiskers, out she passed;<span class='linenum'>325</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after her&mdash;making (he hoped) a face<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like Emperor Nero or Sultan Saladin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stalked the Duke's self with the austere grace<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of ancient hero or modern paladin,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From door to staircase&mdash;oh, such a solemn<span class='linenum'>330</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unbending of the vertebral column!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">However, at sunrise our company mustered;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And here was the huntsman bidding unkennel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there 'neath his bonnet the pricker blustered,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With feather dank as a bough of wet fennel;<span class='linenum'>335</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the courtyard walls were filled with fog<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You might have cut as an ax chops a log&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like so much wool for color and bulkiness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out rode the Duke in a perfect sulkiness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since, before breakfast, a man feels but queasily,<span class='linenum'>340</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">And a sinking at the lower abdomen<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Begins the day with indifferent omen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo, as he looked around uneasily,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun plowed the fog up and drove it asunder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This way and that from the valley under;<span class='linenum'>345</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">And, looking through the court-yard arch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down in the valley, what should meet him<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But a troop of gypsies on their march?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No doubt with the annual gifts to greet him.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, in your land, gypsies reach you only<span class='linenum'>350</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">After reaching all lands beside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">North they go, South they go, trooping or lonely,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And still, as they travel far and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Catch they and keep now a trace here, a trace there,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span><span class="i0">That puts you in mind of a place here, a place there<span class='linenum'>335</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with us, I believe they rise out of the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nowhere else, I take it, are found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the earth-tint yet so freshly embrowned:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Born, no doubt, like insects which breed on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very fruit they are meant to feed on.<span class='linenum'>360</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the earth&mdash;not a use to which they don't turn it,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The ore that grows in the mountain's womb,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or the sand in the pits like a honeycomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sift and soften it, bake it and burn it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether they weld you, for instance, a snaffle<span class='linenum'>365</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With side-bars never a brute can baffle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or a lock that's a puzzle of wards within wards;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if your colt's forefoot inclines to curve inwards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horseshoes they hammer which turn on a swivel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And won't allow the hoof to shrivel.<span class='linenum'>370</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they cast bells like the shell of the winkle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That keep a stout heart in the ram with their tinkle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the sand&mdash;they pinch and pound it like otters;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commend me the gypsy glass-makers and potters!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glasses they'll blow you, crystal-clear,<span class='linenum'>375</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where just a faint cloud of rose shall appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if in pure water you dropped and let die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bruised black-blooded mulberry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that other sort, their crowning pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With long white threads distinct inside,<span class='linenum'>380</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the lake-flower's fibrous roots which dangle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loose such a length and never tangle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the bold sword-lily cuts the clear waters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cup-lily couches with all the white daughters:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such are the works they put their hand to,<span class='linenum'>385</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The uses they turn and twist iron and sand to.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these made the troop, which our Duke saw sally<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward his castle from out of the valley,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men and women, like new-hatched spiders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come out with the morning to greet our riders.<span class='linenum'>390</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up they wound till they reached the ditch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat all stopped save one, a witch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I knew, as she hobbled from the group,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By her gait directly and her stoop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, whom Jacynth was used to importune<span class='linenum'>395</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To let that same witch tell us our fortune.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The oldest gypsy then above ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And, sure as the autumn season came round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She paid us a visit for profit or pastime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every time, as she swore, for the last time.<span class='linenum'>400</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And presently she was seen to sidle<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Up to the Duke till she touched his bridle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that the horse of a sudden reared up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As under its nose the old witch peered up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her worn-out eyes, or rather eye-holes<span class='linenum'>405</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of no use now but to gather brine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And began a kind of level whine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as they used to sing to their viols<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When their ditties they go grinding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up and down with nobody minding;<span class='linenum'>410</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, as of old, at the end of the humming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her usual presents were forthcoming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;A dog-whistle blowing the fiercest of trebles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Just a seashore stone holding a dozen fine pebbles),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or a porcelain mouthpiece to screw on a pipe-end&mdash;<span class='linenum'>415</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so she awaited her annual stipend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this time the Duke would scarcely vouchsafe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">A word in reply; and in vain she felt<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With twitching fingers at her belt<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For the purse of sleek pine-marten pelt,<span class='linenum'>420</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ready to put what he gave in her pouch safe&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, either to quicken his apprehension,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or possibly with an after-intention,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was come, she said, to pay her duty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the new Duchess, the youthful beauty.<span class='linenum'>425</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sooner had she named his lady<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than a shine lit up the face so shady,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its smirk returned with a novel meaning&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it struck him, the babe just wanted weaning;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If one gave her a taste of what life was and sorrow,<span class='linenum'>430</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, foolish today, would be wiser tomorrow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who so fit a teacher of trouble<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As this sordid crone bent well-nigh double?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, glancing at her wolf-skin vesture,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">(If such it was, for they grow so hirsute<span class='linenum'>435</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">That their own fleece serves for natural fur-suit)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was contrasting, 'twas plain from his gesture,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The life of the lady so flower-like and delicate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the loathsome squalor of this helicat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, in brief, was the man the Duke beckoned<span class='linenum'>440</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">From out of the throng, and while I drew near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He told the crone&mdash;as I since have reckoned<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By the way he bent and spoke into her ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With circumspection and mystery&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The main of the lady's history,<span class='linenum'>445</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her frowardness and ingratitude:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for all the crone's submissive attitude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could see round her mouth the loose plaits tightening,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her brow with assenting intelligence brightening,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As though she engaged with hearty goodwill<span class='linenum'>450</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whatever he now might enjoin to fulfill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And promised the lady a thorough frightening.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so, just giving her a glimpse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a purse, with the air of a man who imps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wing of the hawk that shall fetch the hernshaw,<span class='linenum'>455</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">He bade me take the gypsy mother<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And set her telling some story or other<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hill or dale, oak-wood or fernshaw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wile away a weary hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the lady left alone in her bower,<span class='linenum'>460</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose mind and body craved exertion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet shrank from all better diversion.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then clapping heel to his horse, the mere curveter,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Out rode the Duke, and after his hollo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horses and hounds swept, huntsman and servitor,<span class='linenum'>465</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">And back I turned and bade the crone follow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what makes me confident what's to be told you<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Had all along been of this crone's devising,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is, that, on looking round sharply, behold you,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There was a novelty quick as surprising:<span class='linenum'>470</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For first, she had shot up a full head in stature,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And her step kept pace with mine nor faltered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if age had foregone its usurpature,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the ignoble mien was wholly altered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the face looked quite of another nature,<span class='linenum'>475</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the change reached too, whatever the change meant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her shaggy wolf-skin cloak's arrangement:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For where its tatters hung loose like sedges,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold coins were glittering on the edges,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the band-roll strung with tomans<span class='linenum'>480</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which proves the veil a Persian woman's:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And under her brow, like a snail's horns newly<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Come out as after the rain he paces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two unmistakable eye-points duly<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Live and aware looked out of their places.<span class='linenum'>485</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, we went and found Jacynth at the entry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the lady's chamber standing sentry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I told the command and produced my companion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Jacynth rejoiced to admit anyone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For since last night, by the same token,<span class='linenum'>490</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a single word had the lady spoken:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They went in both to the presence together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I in the balcony watched the weather.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now, what took place at the very first of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot tell, as I never could learn it:<span class='linenum'>495</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jacynth constantly wished a curse to fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On that little head of hers and burn it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If she knew how she came to drop so soundly<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Asleep of a sudden and there continue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole time sleeping as profoundly<span class='linenum'>500</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">As one of the boars my father would pin you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt the eyes where life holds garrison,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Jacynth forgive me the comparison!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But where I begin my own narration<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span><span class="i0">Is a little after I took my station<span class='linenum'>505</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To breathe the fresh air from the balcony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, having in those days a falcon eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To follow the hunt through the open country,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From where the bushes thinlier crested<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hillocks, to a plain where's not one tree.<span class='linenum'>510</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">When, in a moment, my ear was arrested<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By&mdash;was it singing, or was it saying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or a strange musical instrument playing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the chamber?&mdash;and to be certain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pushed the lattice, pulled the curtain,<span class='linenum'>515</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there lay Jacynth asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet as if a watch she tried to keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a rosy sleep along the floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her head against the door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While in the midst, on the seat of state,<span class='linenum'>520</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was a queen&mdash;the gypsy woman late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With head and face downbent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the lady's head and face intent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, coiled at her feet like a child at ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lady sat between her knees,<span class='linenum'>525</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er them the lady's clasped hands met,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on those hands her chin was set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her upturned face met the face of the crone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein the eyes had grown and grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if she could double and quadruple<span class='linenum'>530</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At pleasure the play of either pupil<br /></span>
<span class="i1">&mdash;Very like, by her hands' slow fanning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As up and down like a gor-crow's flappers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They moved to measure, or bell-clappers.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I said, "Is it blessing, is it banning,<span class='linenum'>535</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do they applaud you or burlesque you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those hands and fingers with no flesh on?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, just as I thought to spring in to the rescue,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At once I was stopped by the lady's expression:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it was life her eyes were drinking<span class='linenum'>540</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the crone's wide pair above unwinking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Life's pure fire received without shrinking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the heart and breast whose heaving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told you no single drop they were leaving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Life, that filling her, passed redundant<span class='linenum'>545</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Into her very hair, back swerving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over each shoulder, loose and abundant,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As her head thrown back showed the white throat curving;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the very tresses shared in the pleasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moving to the mystic measure,<span class='linenum'>550</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bounding as the bosom bounded.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stopped short, more and more confounded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As still her cheeks burned and eyes glistened,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she listened and she listened:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all at once a hand detained me,<span class='linenum'>555</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The selfsame contagion gained me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I kept time to the wondrous chime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making out words and prose and rhyme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till it seemed that the music furled<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Its wings like a task fulfilled, and dropped<span class='linenum'>560</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">From under the words it first had propped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left them midway in the world:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Word took word as hand takes hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could hear at last, and understand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when I held the unbroken thread,<span class='linenum'>565</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gypsy said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And so at last we find my tribe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so I set thee in the midst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to one and all of them describe<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What thou saidst and what thou didst,<span class='linenum'>570</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our long and terrible journey through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all thou art ready to say and do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the trials that remain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I trace them the vein and the other vein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That meet on thy brow and part again,<span class='linenum'>575</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making our rapid mystic mark;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And I bid my people prove and probe<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Each eye's profound and glorious globe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they detect the kindred spark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In those depths so dear and dark,<span class='linenum'>580</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the spots that snap and burst and flee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Circling over the midnight sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on that round young cheek of thine<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I make them recognize the tinge,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">But what? For here her voice changed like a bird's;<span class='linenum'>690</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">There grew more of the music and less of the words;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had Jacynth only been by me to clap pen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To paper and put you down every syllable<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With those clever clerkly fingers,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All I've forgotten as well as what lingers<span class='linenum'>695</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this old brain of mine that's but ill able<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give you even this poor version<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of the speech I spoil, as it were, with stammering<br /></span>
<span class="i1">&mdash;More fault of those who had the hammering<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of prosody into me and syntax,<span class='linenum'>700</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">And did it, not with hobnails but tin-tacks!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to return from this excursion&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just, do you mark, when the song was sweetest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The peace most deep and the charm completest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came, shall I say, a snap&mdash;<span class='linenum'>705</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the charm vanished!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And my sense returned, so strangely banished,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, starting as from a nap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew the crone was bewitching my lady,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Jacynth asleep; and but one spring made I<span class='linenum'>710</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down from the casement, round to the portal,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Another minute and I had entered&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the door opened, and more than mortal<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Stood, with a face where to my mind centered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All beauties I ever saw or shall see,<span class='linenum'>715</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Duchess: I stopped as if struck by palsy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was so different, happy and beautiful,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I felt at once that all was best,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And that I had nothing to do, for the rest,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span><span class="i0">But wait her commands, obey and be dutiful.<span class='linenum'>720</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not that, in fact, there was any commanding;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I saw the glory of her eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the brow's height and the breast's expanding,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And I was hers to live or to die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for finding what she wanted,<span class='linenum'>725</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know God Almighty granted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such little signs should serve wild creatures<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To tell one another all their desires,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So that each knows what his friend requires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And does its bidding without teachers.<span class='linenum'>730</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I preceded her: the crone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed silent and alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I spoke to her, but she merely jabbered<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In the old style; both her eyes had slunk<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Back to their pits; her stature shrunk;<span class='linenum'>735</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">In short, the soul in its body sunk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a blade sent home to its scabbard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We descended, I preceding;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crossed the court with nobody heeding;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the world was at the chase,<span class='linenum'>740</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The courtyard like a desert-place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stable emptied of its small fry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saddled myself the very palfrey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I remember patting while it carried her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day she arrived and the Duke married her.<span class='linenum'>745</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, do you know, though it's easy deceiving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oneself in such matters, I can't help believing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lady had not forgotten it either,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knew the poor devil so much beneath her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would have been only too glad for her service<span class='linenum'>750</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dance on hot plowshares like a Turk dervise,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, unable to pay proper duty where owing it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was reduced to that pitiful method of showing it:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though the moment I began setting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His saddle on my own nag of Berold's begetting,<span class='linenum'>755</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Not that I meant to be obtrusive)<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She stopped me, while his rug was shifting,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By a single rapid finger's lifting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with a gesture kind but conclusive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a little shake of the head, refused me&mdash;<span class='linenum'>760</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I say, although she never used me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet when she was mounted, the gypsy behind her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I ventured to remind her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I suppose with a voice of less steadiness<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Than usual, for my feeling exceeded me,<span class='linenum'>765</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Something to the effect that I was in readiness<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whenever God should please she needed me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, do you know, her face looked down on me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a look that placed a crown on me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she felt in her bosom&mdash;mark, her bosom&mdash;<span class='linenum'>770</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as a flower-tree drops its blossom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dropped me ... ah, had it been a purse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of silver, my friend, or gold that's worse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, you see, as soon as I found myself<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So understood&mdash;that a true heart so may gain<span class='linenum'>775</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Such a reward&mdash;I should have gone home again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kissed Jacynth, and soberly drowned myself!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a little plait of hair<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Such as friends in a convent make<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To wear, each for the other's sake&mdash;<span class='linenum'>780</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This, see, which at my breast I wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever did (rather to Jacynth's grudgment),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever shall, till the Day of Judgment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then&mdash;and then&mdash;to cut short&mdash;this is idle,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">These are feelings it is not good to foster&mdash;<span class='linenum'>785</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pushed the gate wide, she shook the bridle,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the palfrey bounded&mdash;and so we lost her.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the liquor's out why clink the cannikin?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Always made me&mdash;and no doubt makes you&mdash;sick.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, to my mind, the world's face looked so stern<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That no one should touch on the story to wake it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the wound in the Duke's pride rankled fiery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, they made no search and small inquiry&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when fresh gypsies have paid us a visit, I've<span class='linenum'>815</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noticed the couple were never inquisitive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But told them they're folks the Duke don't want here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade them make haste and cross the frontier.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brief, the Duchess was gone and the Duke was glad of it,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the old one was in the young one's stead,<span class='linenum'>820</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">He is our Duke, after all,<span class='linenum'>855</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, as he says, but a serf and thrall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father was born here, and I inherit<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Could I pay in a lump I should prefer it,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But there's no mine to blow up and get done with:<span class='linenum'>860</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, I must stay till the end of the chapter.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Be it a thing to be glad on or sorry on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some day or other, his head in a morion<br /></span>

<span class="i1">And our children all went the way of the roses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's a long lane that knows no turnings.<br /></span>

<span class="i1">To the big-boned stock of mighty Berold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, for strong Cotnar, drank French weak wine,<span class='linenum'>905</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He also must be such a lady's scorner!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Smooth Jacob still robs homely Esau:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now up, now down, the world's one see-saw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;So, I shall find out some snug corner<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under a hedge, like Orson the wood-knight,<span class='linenum'>910</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn myself round and bid the world good night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sleep a sound sleep till the trumpet's blowing<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wakes me (unless priests cheat us laymen)<br /></span>

<h2>"CHILDE ROLAND TO THE DARK TOWER CAME"</h2>
<h3>(See Edgar's song in <i>Lear</i>)</h3>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My first thought was, he lied in every word,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That hoary cripple, with malicious eye<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Askance to watch the working of his lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On mine, and mouth scarce able to afford<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suppression of the glee, that pursed and scored<span class='linenum'>5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Its edge, at one more victim gained thereby.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What else should he be set for, with his staff?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What, save to waylay with his lies, ensnare<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All travelers who might find him posted there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ask the road? I guessed what skull-like laugh<span class='linenum'>10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would break, what crutch 'gin write my epitaph<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For pastime in the dusty thoroughfare,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If at his counsel I should turn aside<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Into the ominous tract which, all agree,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hides the Dark Tower. Yet acquiescingly<span class='linenum'>15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I did turn as he pointed: neither pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor hope rekindling at the end descried,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So much as gladness that some end might be.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For, what with my whole world-wide wandering,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What with my search drawn out through years, my hope<span class='linenum'>20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dwindled into a ghost not fit to cope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that obstreperous joy success would bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hardly tried now to rebuke the spring<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My heart made, finding failure in its scope.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when a sick man very near to death<span class='linenum'>25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Seems dead indeed, and feels begin and end<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The tears, and takes the farewell of each friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hears one bid the other go, draw breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freelier outside ("since all is o'er," he saith,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"And the blow fallen no grieving can amend");<span class='linenum'>30</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While some discuss if near the other graves<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Be room enough for this, and when a day<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Suits best for carrying the corpse away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With care about the banners, scarves, and staves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still the man hears all, and only craves<span class='linenum'>35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">He may not shame such tender love and stay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus, I had so long suffered in this quest,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Heard failure prophesied so oft, been writ<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So many times among "The Band"&mdash;to wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The knights who to the Dark Tower's search addressed<span class='linenum'>40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their steps&mdash;that just to fail as they, seemed best,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And all the doubt was now&mdash;should I be fit?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, quiet as despair, I turned from him,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That hateful cripple, out of his highway<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Into the path he pointed. All the day<span class='linenum'>45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been a dreary one at best, and dim<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Red leer to see the plain catch its estray.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For mark! no sooner was I fairly found<br /></span>

<span class="i1">I might go on; naught else remained to do.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, on I went. I think I never saw<span class='linenum'>55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Such starved ignoble nature; nothing throve;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But cockle, spurge, according to their law<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might propagate their kind, with none to awe,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">You'd think; a bur had been a treasure-trove.<span class='linenum'>60</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No! penury, inertness, and grimace,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If there pushed any ragged thistle-stalk<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In the dock's harsh swarth leaves, bruised as to balk<span class='linenum'>70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">All hope of greenness? 'tis a brute must walk<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One stiff blind horse, his every bone a-stare,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I only knew one poet in my life:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this, or something like it, was his way.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">You saw go up and down Valladolid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man of mark, to know next time you saw.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span><span class="i0">His very serviceable suit of black<span class='linenum'>5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was courtly once and conscientious still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many might have worn it, though none did;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cloak, that somewhat shone and showed the threads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had purpose, and the ruff, significance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He walked and tapped the pavement with his cane,<span class='linenum'>10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scenting the world, looking it full in face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An old dog, bald and blindish, at his heels.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Trying the mortar's temper 'tween the chinks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some new shop a-building, French and fine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stood and watched the cobbler at his trade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man who slices lemons into drink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coffee-roaster's brazier, and the boys<span class='linenum'>25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That volunteer to help him turn its winch.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He glanced o'er books on stalls with half an eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fly-leaf ballads on the vender's string,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And broad-edge bold-print posters by the wall.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Come, what am I a beast for? tell us, now!<span class='linenum'>80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was a baby when my mother died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And father died and left me in the street.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I starved there, God knows how, a year or two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On fig-skins, melon-parings, rinds and shucks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refuse and rubbish. One fine frosty day,<span class='linenum'>85</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My stomach being empty as your hat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind doubled me up and down I went.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Aunt Lapaccia trussed me with one hand<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By the straight cut to the convent. Six words there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I stood munching my first bread that month:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"So, boy, you've minded," quoth the good fat father,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wiping his own mouth&mdash;'twas refection-time&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To quit this very miserable world?<span class='linenum'>95</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">By no means! Brief, they made a monk of me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I did renounce the world, its pride and greed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Palace, farm, villa, shop, and banking-house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trash, such as these poor devils of Medici<span class='linenum'>100</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Well, sir, I found in time, you may be sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas not for nothing&mdash;the good bellyful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The warm serge and the rope that goes all round,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Let's see what the urchin's fit for"&mdash;that came next.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not overmuch their way, I must confess.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such a to-do! They tried me with their books;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But, mind you, when a boy starves in the streets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eight years together, as my fortune was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching folk's faces to know who will fling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bit of half-stripped grape-bunch he desires,<span class='linenum'>115</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who will curse or kick him for his pains&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which gentleman processional and fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding a candle to the Sacrament,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will wink and let him lift a plate and catch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The droppings of the wax to sell again,<span class='linenum'>120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or holla for the Eight and have him whipped&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How say I?&mdash;nay, which dog bites, which lets drop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bone from the heap of offal in the street&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, soul and sense of him grow sharp alike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He learns the look of things, and none the less<span class='linenum'>125</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For admonition from the hunger-pinch.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had a store of such remarks, be sure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, after I found leisure, turned to use.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Scrawled them within the antiphonary's marge,<span class='linenum'>130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joined legs and arms to the long music-notes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found eyes and nose and chin for A's and B's,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made a string of pictures of the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the ins and outs of verb and noun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the wall, the bench, the door. The monks looked black.<span class='linenum'>135</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay," quoth the Prior, "turn him out, d'ye say?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In no wise. Lose a crow and catch a lark.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What if at last we get our man of parts,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And Preaching Friars, to do our church up fine<span class='linenum'>140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put the front on it that ought to be!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hereupon he bade me daub away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thank you! my head being crammed, the walls a blank,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">First, every sort of monk, the black and white,<span class='linenum'>145</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I drew them, fat and lean: then, folk at church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From good old gossips waiting to confess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their cribs of barrel-droppings, candle-ends&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the breathless fellow at the altar-foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh from his murder, safe and sitting there<span class='linenum'>150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the little children round him in a row<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of admiration, half for his beard and half<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that white anger of his victim's son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaking a fist at him with one fierce arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Signing himself with the other because of Christ<span class='linenum'>155</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Whose sad face on the cross sees only this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the passion of a thousand years)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till some poor girl, her apron o'er her head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Which the intense eyes looked through) came at eve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On tiptoe, said a word, dropped in a loaf,<span class='linenum'>160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her pair of earrings and a bunch of flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The brute took growling), prayed, and so was gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I painted all, then cried, "'Tis ask and have;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Choose, for more's ready!"&mdash;laid the ladder flat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And showed my covered bit of cloister-wall.<span class='linenum'>165</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monks closed in a circle and praised loud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till checked, taught what to see and not to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being simple bodies&mdash;"That's the very man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look at the boy who stoops to pat the dog!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That woman's like the Prior's niece who comes<span class='linenum'>170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To care about his asthma: it's the life!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there my triumph's straw-fire flared and funked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their betters took their turn to see and say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Prior and the learned pulled a face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stopped all that in no time. "How? what's here?<span class='linenum'>175</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quite from the mark of painting, bless us all!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faces, arms, legs, and bodies like the true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As much as pea and pea! It's devil's-game!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your business is not to catch men with show,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But lift them over it, ignore it all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make them forget there's such a thing as flesh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your business is to paint the souls of men&mdash;-<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man's soul, and it's a fire, smoke ... no, it's not ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's vapor done up like a new-born babe&mdash;<span class='linenum'>185</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(In that shape when you die it leaves your mouth)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's ... well, what matters talking, it's the soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give us no more of body than shows soul!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here's Giotto, with his Saint a-praising God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sets us praising&mdash;why not stop with him?<span class='linenum'>190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why put all thoughts of praise out of our head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wonder at lines, colors, and what not?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paint the soul; never mind the legs and arms!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rub all out; try at it a second time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, that white smallish female with the breasts,<span class='linenum'>195</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She's just my niece ... Herodias, I would say&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who went and danced and got men's heads cut off!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have it all out!" Now, is this sense, I ask?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fine way to paint soul, by painting body<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So ill the eye can't stop there, must go further,<span class='linenum'>200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And can't fare worse! Thus, yellow does for white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When what you put for yellow's simply black,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And any sort of meaning looks intense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all beside itself means and looks naught.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why can't a painter lift each foot in turn,<span class='linenum'>205</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left foot and right foot, go a double step,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make his flesh liker and his soul more like,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both in their order? Take the prettiest face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Prior's niece ... patron-saint&mdash;is it so pretty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You can't discover if it means hope, fear,<span class='linenum'>210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow, or joy? Won't beauty go with these?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suppose I've made her eyes all right and blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can't I take breath and try to add life's flash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then add soul and heighten them three-fold?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or say there's beauty with no soul at all&mdash;<span class='linenum'>215</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I never saw it&mdash;put the case the same&mdash;)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you get simple beauty and naught else,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You get about the best thing God invents:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's somewhat: and you'll find the soul you have missed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within yourself, when you return Him thanks.<span class='linenum'>220</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Rub all out!" Well, well, there's my life, in short,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so the thing has gone on ever since.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm grown a man no doubt; I've broken bounds:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And yet the old schooling sticks, the old grave eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are peeping o'er my shoulder as I work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heads shake still&mdash;"It's art's decline, my son!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They with their Latin? So, I swallow my rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clench my teeth, suck my lips in tight, and paint<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For, doing most, there's pretty sure to come<span class='linenum'>245</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A turn, some warm eve finds me at my saints&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The world and life's too big to pass for a dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I do these wild things in sheer despite,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Back I shrink&mdash;what is this I see and hear?<span class='linenum'>365</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, caught up with my monk's-things by mistake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My old serge gown and rope that goes all round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, in this presence, this pure company!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where's a hole, where's a corner for escape?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then steps a sweet angelic slip of a thing<span class='linenum'>370</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forward, puts out a soft palm&mdash;"Not so fast!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Addresses the celestial presence, "nay&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He made you and devised you, after all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he's none of you! Could Saint John there draw&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His camel-hair make up a painting-brush?<span class='linenum'>375</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We come to brother Lippo for all that,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Iste perfecit opus!</i>" So, all smile&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shuffle sideways with my blushing face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the cover of a hundred wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrown like a spread of kirtles when you're gay<span class='linenum'>380</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And play hot cockles, all the doors being shut,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, wholly unexpected, in there pops<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hothead husband! Thus I scuttle off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To some safe bench behind, not letting go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The palm of her, the little lily thing<span class='linenum'>385</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That spoke the good word for me in the nick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the Prior's niece ... Saint Lucy, I would say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so all's saved for me, and for the church<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pretty picture gained. Go, six months hence!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your hand, sir, and good-by: no lights, no lights!<span class='linenum'>390</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The street's hushed, and I know my own way back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don't fear me! There's the gray beginning. Zooks!<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But do not let us quarrel any more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, my Lucrezia; bear with me for once:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sit down and all shall happen as you wish.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You turn your face, but does it bring your heart?<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span><span class="i0">I'll work then for your friend's friend, never fear,<span class='linenum'>5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Treat his own subject after his own way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fix his own time, accept too his own price,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shut the money into this small hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When next it takes mine. Will it? tenderly?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, I'll content him&mdash;but tomorrow, Love!<span class='linenum'>10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I often am much wearier than you think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This evening more than usual, and it seems<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if&mdash;forgive now&mdash;should you let me sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here by the window with your hand in mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And look a half-hour forth on Fiesole,<span class='linenum'>15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both of one mind, as married people use,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quietly, quietly the evening through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I might get up tomorrow to my work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheerful and fresh as ever. Let us try.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tomorrow, how you shall be glad for this!<span class='linenum'>20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your soft hand is a woman of itself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mine the man's bared breast she curls inside.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don't count the time lost, neither; you must serve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For each of the five pictures we require:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It saves a model. So! keep looking so&mdash;<span class='linenum'>25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My serpentining beauty, rounds on rounds!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;How could you ever prick those perfect ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even to put the pearl there! oh, so sweet&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My face, my moon, my everybody's moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which everybody looks on and calls his,<span class='linenum'>30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, I suppose, is looked on by in turn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While she looks&mdash;no one's: very dear, no less.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You smile? why, there's my picture ready made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's what we painters call our harmony!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A common grayness silvers everything&mdash;<span class='linenum'>35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">All in a twilight, you and I alike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;You, at the point of your first pride in me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(That's gone you know)&mdash;but I, at every point;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My youth, my hope, my art, being all toned down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To yonder sober, pleasant Fiesole.<span class='linenum'>40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's the bell clinking from the chapel-top;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That length of convent-wall across the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holds the trees safer, huddled more inside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last monk leaves the garden; days decrease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And autumn grows, autumn in everything.<span class='linenum'>45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eh? the whole seems to fall into a shape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if I saw alike my work and self<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all that I was born to be and do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A twilight-piece. Love, we are in God's hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How strange now looks the life He makes us lead;<span class='linenum'>50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So free we seem, so fettered fast we are!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I feel He laid the fetter: let it lie!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This chamber for example&mdash;turn your head&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that's behind us! You don't understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor care to understand about my art,<span class='linenum'>55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you can hear at least when people speak:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that cartoon, the second from the door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;It is the thing, Love! so such thing should be&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold Madonna!&mdash;I am bold to say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can do with my pencil what I know,<span class='linenum'>60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What I see, what at bottom of my heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wish for, if I ever wish so deep&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do easily, too&mdash;when I say, perfectly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do not boast, perhaps: yourself are judge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who listened to the Legate's talk last week,<span class='linenum'>65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And just as much they used to say in France.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At any rate 'tis easy, all of it!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sketches first, no studies, that's long past:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do what many dream of, all their lives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Dream? strive to do, and agonize to do,<span class='linenum'>70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fail in doing. I could count twenty such<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On twice your fingers, and not leave this town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who strive&mdash;you don't know how the others strive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To paint a little thing like that you smeared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carelessly passing with your robes afloat&mdash;<span class='linenum'>75</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet do much less, so much less, Someone says,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I know his name, no matter)&mdash;so much less!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, less is more, Lucrezia: I am judged.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There burns a truer light of God in them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain,<span class='linenum'>80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heart, or whate'er else, than goes on to prompt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This low-pulsed forthright craftsman's hand of mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their works drop groundward, but themselves, I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reach many a time a heaven that's shut to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enter and take their place there sure enough,<span class='linenum'>85</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though they come back and cannot tell the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My works are nearer heaven, but I sit here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sudden blood of these men! at a word&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Praise them, it boils, or blame them, it boils too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, painting from myself and to myself,<span class='linenum'>90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know what I do, am unmoved by men's blame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or their praise either. Somebody remarks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Morello's outline there is wrongly traced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hue mistaken; what of that? or else,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rightly traced and well ordered; what of that?<span class='linenum'>95</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak as they please, what does the mountain care?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or what's a heaven for? All is silver-gray<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Placid and perfect with my art: the worse!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know both what I want and what might gain,<span class='linenum'>100</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet how profitless to know, to sigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Had I been two, another and myself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our head would have o'erlooked the world!" No doubt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yonder's a work now, of that famous youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Urbinate who died five years ago.<span class='linenum'>105</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">('Tis copied, George Vasari sent it me.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, I can fancy how he did it all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reaching, that heaven might so replenish him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above and through his art&mdash;for it gives way;<span class='linenum'>110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That arm is wrongly put&mdash;and there again&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fault to pardon in the drawing's lines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its body, so to speak: its soul is right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He means right&mdash;that, a child may understand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still, what an arm! and I could alter it:<span class='linenum'>115</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all the play, the insight and the stretch&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of me, out of me! And wherefore out?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We might have risen to Rafael, I and you!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think&mdash;<span class='linenum'>120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than I merit, yes, by many times.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But had you&mdash;oh, with the same perfect brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare&mdash;<span class='linenum'>125</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some women do so. Had the mouth there urged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"God and the glory! never care for gain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The present by the future, what is that?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live for fame, side by side with Agnolo!<span class='linenum'>130</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I might have done it for you. So it seems:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps not. All is as God overrules.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside, incentives come from the soul's self;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest avail not. Why do I need you?<span class='linenum'>135</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this world, who can do a thing, will not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who would do it, cannot, I perceive:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the will's somewhat&mdash;somewhat, too, the power&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus we half-men struggle. At the end,<span class='linenum'>140</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">God, I conclude, compensates, punishes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis safer for me, if the award be strict,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I am something underrated here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I dared not, do you know, leave home all day,<span class='linenum'>145</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fear of chancing on the Paris lords.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The best is when they pass and look aside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they speak sometimes; I must bear it all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well may they speak! That Francis, that first time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that long festal year at Fontainebleau!<span class='linenum'>150</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I surely then could sometimes leave the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put on the glory, Rafael's daily wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that humane great monarch's golden look&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One finger in his beard or twisted curl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over his mouth's good mark that made the smile,<span class='linenum'>155</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">One arm about my shoulder, round my neck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The jingle of his gold chain in my ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, painting proudly with his breath on me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All his court round him, seeing with his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span><span class="i0">Such frank French eyes, and such a fire of souls<span class='linenum'>160</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, best of all, this, this, this face beyond,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This in the background, waiting on my work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To crown the issue with a last reward!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A good time, was it not, my kingly days?<span class='linenum'>165</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And load you not grown restless ... but I know&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis done and past; 'twas right, my instinct said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too live the life grew, golden and not gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the grange whose four walls make his world.<span class='linenum'>170</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">How could it end in any other way?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You called me, and I came home to your heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The triumph was&mdash;to reach and stay there; since<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I reached it ere the triumph, what is lost?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let my hands frame your face in your hair's gold,<span class='linenum'>175</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Rafael did this, Andrea painted that;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Roman's is the better when you pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still the other's Virgin was his wife"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men will excuse me. I am glad to judge<span class='linenum'>180</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both pictures in your presence; clearer grows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My better fortune, I resolve to think.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, do you know, Lucrezia, as God lives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said one day Agnolo, his very self,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Rafael ... I have known it all these years ...<span class='linenum'>185</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(When the young man was flaming out his thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too lifted up in heart because of it)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Friend, there's a certain sorry little scrub<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goes up and down our Florence, none cares how,<span class='linenum'>190</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, were he set to plan and execute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As you are, pricked on by your popes and kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Rafael's!&mdash;And indeed the arm is wrong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hardly dare ... yet, only you to see,<span class='linenum'>195</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give the chalk here&mdash;quick, thus the line should go!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aye, but the soul! he's Rafael! rub it out!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still, all I care for, if he spoke the truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(What he? why, who but Michel Agnolo?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do you forget already words like those?)<span class='linenum'>200</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If really there was such a chance, so lost&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is, whether you're&mdash;not grateful&mdash;but more pleased.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, let me think so. And you smile indeed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This hour has been an hour! Another smile?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you would sit thus by me every night<span class='linenum'>205</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should work better, do you comprehend?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mean that I should earn more, give you more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See, it is settled dusk now; there's a star;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Morello's gone, the watch-lights show the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cue-owls speak the name we call them by.<span class='linenum'>210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come from the window, love&mdash;come in, at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inside the melancholy little house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We built to be so gay with. God is just.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Francis may forgive me: oft at nights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I look up from painting, eyes tired out,<span class='linenum'>215</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The walls become illumined, brick from brick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distinct, instead of mortar, fierce bright gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gold of his I did cement them with!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us but love each other. Must you go?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Cousin here again? He waits outside?<span class='linenum'>220</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must see you&mdash;you, and not with me? Those loans?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More gaming debts to pay? You smiled for that?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, let smiles buy me! Have you more to spend?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While hand and eye and something of a heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are left me, work's my ware, and what's it worth?<span class='linenum'>225</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll pay my fancy. Only let me sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gray remainder of the evening out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Idle, you call it, and muse perfectly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How I could paint, were I but back in France,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One picture, just one more&mdash;the Virgin's face,<span class='linenum'>230</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not yours this time! I want you at my side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear them&mdash;that is, Michel Agnolo&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Judge all I do and tell you of its worth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will you? Tomorrow, satisfy your friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I take the subjects for his corridor,<span class='linenum'>235</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Finish the portrait out of hand&mdash;there, there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And throw him in another thing or two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he demurs; the whole should prove enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pay for this same Cousin's freak. Beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What's better and what's all I care about,<span class='linenum'>240</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love, does that please you? Ah, but what does he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Cousin! what does he to please you more?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">I am grown peaceful as old age tonight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I regret little, I would change still less.<span class='linenum'>245</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since there my past life lies, why alter it?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very wrong to Francis!&mdash;it is true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I took his coin, was tempted and complied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And built this house and sinned, and all is said.<br /></span>

<h2>THE BISHOP ORDERS HIS TOMB AT SAINT PRAXED'S CHURCH</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">Rome</span>, 15&mdash;</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Vanity, saith the preacher, vanity!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draw round my bed: is Anselm keeping back?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nephews&mdash;sons mine ... ah God, I know not! Well&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, men would have to be your mother once,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Gandolf envied me, so fair she was!<span class='linenum'>5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What's done is done, and she is dead beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dead long ago, and I am Bishop since,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as she died so must we die ourselves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thence ye may perceive the world's a dream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life, how and what is it? As here I lie<span class='linenum'>10</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this state-chamber, dying by degrees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hours and long hours in the dead night, I ask<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Do I live, am I dead?" Peace, peace seems all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saint Praxed's ever was the church for peace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so, about this tomb of mine. I fought<span class='linenum'>15</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tooth and nail to save my niche, ye know:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Old Gandolf cozened me, despite my care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrewd was that snatch from out the corner South<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He graced his carrion with, God curse the same!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still my niche is not so cramped but thence<span class='linenum'>20</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">One sees the pulpit o' the epistle-side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And somewhat of the choir, those silent seats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up into the aery dome where live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The angels, and a sunbeam's sure to lurk:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I shall fill my slab of basalt there,<span class='linenum'>25</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'neath my tabernacle take my rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With those nine columns round me, two and two,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The odd one at my feet where Anselm stands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peach-blossom marble all, the rare, the ripe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fresh-poured red wine of a mighty pulse.<span class='linenum'>30</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Old Gandolf with his paltry onion-stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put me where I may look at him! True peach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rosy and flawless: how I earned the prize!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draw close: that conflagration of my church<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;What then? So much was saved if aught were missed!<span class='linenum'>35</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sons, ye would not be my death? Go dig<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white-grape vineyard where the oil-press stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drop water gently till the surface sink,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if ye find ... Ah God, I know not, I! ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bedded in store of rotten fig-leaves soft,<span class='linenum'>40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And corded up in a tight olive-frail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some lump, ah God, of <i>lapis lazuli</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Big as a Jew's head cut off at the nape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blue as a vein o'er the Madonna's breast ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sons, all have I bequeathed you, villas, all,<span class='linenum'>45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That brave Frascati villa with its bath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, let the blue lump poise between my knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like God the Father's globe on both his hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye worship in the Jesu Church so gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Gandolf shall not choose but see and burst!<span class='linenum'>50</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift as a weaver's shuttle fleet our years:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man goeth to the grave, and where is he?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did I say basalt for my slab, sons? Black&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas ever antique-black I meant! How else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall ye contrast my frieze to come beneath?<span class='linenum'>55</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bas-relief in bronze ye promised me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those Pan and Nymphs ye wot of, and perchance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some tripod, thyrsus, with a vase or so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Savior at his sermon on the mount,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saint Praxed in a glory, and one Pan<span class='linenum'>60</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ready to twitch the Nymph's last garment off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Moses with the tables ... but I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye mark me not! What do they whisper thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Child of my bowels, Anselm? Ah, ye hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To revel down my villas while I gasp<span class='linenum'>65</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bricked o'er with beggar's moldy travertine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Gandolf from his tomb-top chuckles at!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, boys, ye love me&mdash;all of jasper, then!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis jasper ye stand pledged to, lest I grieve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My bath must needs be left behind, alas!<span class='linenum'>70</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">One block, pure green as a pistachio-nut,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's plenty jasper somewhere in the world&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have I not Saint Praxed's ear to pray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Horses for ye, and brown Greek manuscripts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mistresses with great smooth marbly limbs?<span class='linenum'>75</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;That's if ye carve my epitaph aright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Choice Latin, picked phrase, Tully's every word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No gaudy ware like Gandolf's second line&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tully, my masters? Ulpian serves his need!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then how I shall lie through centuries,<span class='linenum'>80</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hear the blessed mutter of the mass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see God made and eaten all day long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feel the steady candle-flame, and taste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good strong thick stupefying incense-smoke!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as I lie here, hours of the dead night,<span class='linenum'>85</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dying in state and by such slow degrees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fold my arms as if they clasped a crook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stretch my feet forth straight as stone can point,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the bedclothes, for a mortcloth, drop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into great laps and folds of sculptor's-work:<span class='linenum'>90</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as yon tapers dwindle, and strange thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grow, with a certain humming in my ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the life before I lived this life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this life too, popes, cardinals, and priests,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saint Praxed at his sermon on the mount,<span class='linenum'>95</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your tall pale mother with her talking eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And new-found agate urns as fresh as day,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Evil and brief hath been my pilgrimage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All <i>lapis</i>, all, sons! Else I give the Pope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My villas! Will ye ever eat my heart?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever your eyes were as a lizard's quick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They glitter like your mother's for my soul,<span class='linenum'>105</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ye would heighten my impoverished frieze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Piece out its starved design, and fill my vase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With grapes, and add a visor and a Term,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the tripod ye would tie a lynx<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in his struggle throws the thyrsus down,<span class='linenum'>110</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To comfort me on my entablature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereon I am to lie till I must ask,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Do I live, am I dead?" There, leave me, there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ye have stabbed me with ingratitude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To death&mdash;ye wish it&mdash;God, ye wish it! Stone&mdash;<span class='linenum'>115</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gritstone, a-crumble! Clammy squares which sweat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the corpse they keep were oozing through&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no more <i>lapis</i> to delight the world!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, go! I bless ye. Fewer tapers there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in a row: and, going, turn your backs<span class='linenum'>120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Aye, like departing altar-ministrants,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave me in my church, the church for peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I may watch at leisure if he leers&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Gandolf&mdash;at me, from his onion-stone,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It takes but little water just to touch<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not knowing air's more hidden properties.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To vindicate his purpose in our life:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why stay we on the earth unless to grow?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long since, I imaged, wrote the fiction out,<span class='linenum'>115</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The worth both absolute and relative<span class='linenum'>120</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all his children from the birth of time,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Show where the labor lay and where the ease,<span class='linenum'>125</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prove Zeus' self, the latent everywhere!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is a dream&mdash;but no dream, let us hope,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Provisions packed on mules, a string<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One instant rapidly glanced round,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A wild bush grows and hides my crypt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She picked my glove up while she stripped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A branch off, then rejoined the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that; my glove lay in her breast.<br /></span>

<h3>IV.&mdash;NIGHT</h3>

<span class="i0">I? Oh, as you were remarking, Ugo, the weather is<span class='linenum'>5</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">mild, very unlike winter weather; but I am a Sicilian, you<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Monsignor.</i> Aye, aye, ugh, ugh&mdash;nothing but disappointments<br /></span>
<span class="i0">here below! I remark a considerable payment<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Jules, a foreign sculptor I did my utmost to advance, that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">the Church might be a gainer by us both; he was going<br /></span>
<span class="i0">on hopefully enough, and of a sudden he notifies to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">some marvelous change that has happened in his notions<br /></span>
<span class="i0">of Art. Here's his letter: "He never had a clearly conceived<span class='linenum'>40</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ideal within his brain till today. Yet since his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">could manage a chisel, he has practiced expressing other<br /></span>
<span class="i0">men's Ideals; and, in the very perfection he has attained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">to, he foresees an ultimate failure: his unconscious hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">will pursue its prescribed course of old years, and will reproduce<span class='linenum'>45</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">with a fatal expertness the ancient types, let the<br /></span>
<span class="i0">novel one appear never so palpably to his spirit. There<br /></span>
<span class="i0">is but one method of escape: confiding the virgin type to<br /></span>
<span class="i0">as chaste a hand, he will turn painter instead of sculptor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">and paint, not carve, its characteristics"&mdash;strike out, I<span class='linenum'>50</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">such way, by a poet now, or a musician (spirits who have<br /></span>

<span class="i0">relations were of so indifferent a stamp? Maffeo, my family<br /></span>

<span class="i0">in vice, if not in wealth: but from my boyhood I came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">out from among them, and so am not partaker of their<br /></span>

<span class="i0">from this, by contrast only&mdash;for I, the bishop, am the<br /></span>

<h2><a name="NOTES" id="NOTES"></a>NOTES</h2>

<h3><a href="#Page_65">SONGS FROM PARACELSUS</a></h3>


<p>The poem <i>Paracelsus</i> is divided into five parts, each of which
describes an important period in the experience of Paracelsus, the
celebrated German-Swiss physician, alchemist, and philosopher of the
sixteenth century. Book I tells of the eagerness and pride with which he
set out in his youth to compass all knowledge; he believed himself
commissioned of God to learn Truth and to give it to mankind. Books II
and III show him followed and idolized by multitudes to whom he imparts
the fragments of knowledge he has gained. But though these fragments
seem to his disciples the sum and substance of wisdom, his own mind is
preoccupied with a desolating certainty that he has hardly touched on
the outer confines of truth. In Book IV, after experiencing the
ingratitude of his fickle adherents, he is represented as abjuring the
dreams of his youth. At this point comes the first of the three songs
given in the text. He builds an imaginary altar on which he offers up
the aspirations, the hopes, the plans, with which he had begun his
career.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Song I</span></h4>

<p>1-3. <i>Cassia</i> is an unidentified fragrant plant; the wood of the
<i>sandal</i> tree is also fragrant; <i>labdanum</i> or <i>ladanum</i>, is a resinous
gum of dark color and pungent odor, exuding from various species of the
cistus, a plant found around the Mediterranean; <i>aloe-balls</i> are made
from a bitter resinous juice extracted from the leaves of aloe-plants;
<i>nard</i> is an ointment made from an aromatic plant and used in the East
Indies. These substances have long been traditionally associated in
literature. In <i>Psalms</i> xlv, 8 we read: "All thy garments smell of
myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they
have made thee glad." Milton in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, v, 293, speaks of
"flowering odors, cassia, nard, and balms."</p>

<p>4. <i>Such balsam</i>. The meaning of II. 4-8 is obscure. "Sea-side mountain
pedestals" are presumably cliffs. In the tops of the trees on these
cliffs the wind, weary of its rough work on the ocean, has gently
dropped the fragrant things it has swept up from the island.</p>

<p>9-16. In this stanza the faint sweetness from the spices used in
embalming, and the perfume still clinging to the tapestry in an ancient
royal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span> room carry suggestions of vanished power and beauty that add an
appropriate pathos to the richly piled altar on which Paracelsus is to
offer up the "lovely fancies" of his youth. "Shredded" is a transferred
epithet, referring really to "arras," but transferred to the perfume of
the arras.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Song II.</span> (Book IV)</h4>

<p>When Paracelsus confesses the failure of his pursuit of absolute
knowledge, his friend Festus urges him to redeem the past by making new
use of what he has gained; but Paracelsus has no courage to attempt a
reorganization of his life in accordance with a new ideal. His answer to
Festus is the second of the three songs. He afterwards calls it,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The sad rhyme of the men who proudly clung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their first fault and withered in their pride."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The song is a beautiful and clear allegory, vivid in its pictures, rapid
and musical.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Song III.</span> (Book V)</h4>

<p>In Book V Paracelsus is described as lying ill in the Hospital of St.
Sebastian. Festus is endeavoring to divert the current of his dying
friend's fierce, delirious thoughts into a gentler channel. He brings up
one picture after another of the early happy life of Paracelsus, and
dwells on the grandeur of his mind and achievements, and on the fame
that shall be his. But the desired peace comes only when Festus sings
the song of the river Mayne beside which their youth had been spent. At
the end of the song Paracelsus exclaims,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My heart! they loose my heart, those simple words;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its darkness passes which naught else could touch."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Mayne, or Main, is the most important of the right-hand tributaries
of the Rhine. Wurzburg, where Festus and Paracelsus had been as
students, is on its banks. Its University was especially noted for its
medical department. Mr. Stopford Brooke (<i>The Poetry of Robert
Browning</i>, p. 99) says of this lovely lyric: "I have driven through that
gracious country of low hill and dale and wide water-meadows, where
under flowered banks only a foot high the slow river winds in
gentleness; and this poem is steeped in the sentiment of the scenery.
But, as before, Browning quickly slides away from the beauty of
inanimate nature into a record of the animals that haunt the streams. He
could not get on long with mountains and rivers alone. He must people
them with breathing, feeling things; anything for life!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>
<h3><a href="#Page_69">CAVALIER TUNES</a></h3>


<p>These three, stirring songs represent the gay, reckless loyalty of the
Cavaliers to the cause of King Charles I and their contempt for his
Puritan opposers. The Puritans wore closely cropped hair; hence the
Parliament which came together in 1640 and was controlled by the
opponents of the King, is dubbed "crop-headed." John Pym and John
Hampden were leaders in the struggle against the tyranny of the King.
Hazelrig, Fiennes, and young Sir Henry Vane were also adherents of
Oliver Cromwell. Rupert, Prince of the Palatinate, was a nephew of
Charles I and was a noted cavalry leader on the royal side during the
Civil War. The followers of the King unfurled the royal standard at
Nottingham in August, 1642; Kentish Sir Byng raised a troop and hurried
on to join the main royal army. In September occurred the battle of
Edgehill. The "Noll" (l. 16 of "Give a Rouse") is Oliver Cromwell. The
third song was entitled originally "My Wife Gertrude." It was she who
held the castle of Brancepeth against the Roundheads.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_72">THE LOST LEADER</a></h3>

<p>This poem indignantly records a poet's defection from the cause of
progress and liberty. Who this poet might be was for some time a matter
of conjecture. Wordsworth, Southey, and Charles Kingsley, all of whom
had gone from radicalism in their youth to conservatism in their old
age, were severally proposed as the original of Browning's portrait. The
poem was published in 1845, two years after Wordsworth was made poet
laureate. Early in 1845 Wordsworth was presented at court, a proceeding
which aroused comment&mdash;sometimes amused, sometimes indignant&mdash;from those
who recalled the poet's early scorn of rank and titles. Browning and
Miss Barrett exchanged several gay letters on this subject in May, 1845.
In commenting on a letter from Miss Martineau describing Wordsworth in
his home in 1846, Browning wrote, "Did not Shelley say long ago, 'He had
no more imagination than a pint-pot'&mdash;though in those days he used to
walk about France and Flanders like a man. <i>Now</i>, he is 'most
comfortable in his worldly affairs' and just this comes of it! He lives
the best twenty years of his life after the way of his own heart&mdash;and
when one presses in to see the result of his rare experiment&mdash;what the
<i>one</i> alchemist whom fortune has allowed to get all his coveted
materials and set to work at last with fire and melting pot&mdash;what he
produces after all the talk of him and the like of him; why, you get
<i>pulvis et cinis</i>&mdash;a man at the mercy of the tongs and shovel." In later
life, however, Browning spoke of Wordsworth in a different tone. In a
letter to Mr. Grosart, written Feb. 24, 1875, he said, "I have been
asked the question you now address me with, and as duly answered, I
can't remember how many times. There is no sort of objection to one more
assurance, or rather confession, on my part, that I <i>did</i> in my hasty
youth presume to use the great and venerated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span> personality of Wordsworth
as a sort of painter's model; one from which this or the other
particular feature may be selected and turned to account. Had I intended
more&mdash;above all such a boldness as portraying the entire man&mdash;I should
not have talked about 'handfuls of silver and bits of ribbon.' These
never influenced the change of politics in the great poet&mdash;whose
defection, nevertheless, accompanied as it was by a regular face-about
of his special party, was, to my private apprehension, and even mature
consideration, an event to deplore. But, just as in the tapestry on my
wall I can recognize figures which have <i>struck out</i> a fancy, on
occasion, that though truly enough thus derived, yet would be
preposterous as a copy; so, though I dare not deny the original of my
little poem, I altogether refuse to have it considered as the 'very
effigies' of such a moral and intellectual superiority." For an
interesting parallelism in theme, see Whittier's "Ichabod."</p>

<p>20. <i>Whom.</i> The reference is to the lower classes, whom the Liberals
were endeavoring to rouse to aspiration and action. The Conservatives
opposed such
<a name="corr5" id="corr5"></a><a class="correction" href="#cn5" title="changed from 'beginings'">beginnings</a> of independence.</p>

<p>29. <i>Best fight on well.</i> It is the deserting leader who is exhorted to
fight well. Though it is pain to have him desert their party, they have
gloried in his power and it would be an even greater pain to see him
weak. They wish him to fight well even though their cause is thereby
menaced.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_73">HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX</a></h3>

<p>This poem was written during Mr. Browning's first journey to Italy, in
1838. He sailed from London in a merchant vessel bound for Trieste, on
which he found himself the only passenger. The weather was stormy and
for the first fortnight Browning was extremely ill. As they passed
through the straights of Gibraltar the captain supported him upon deck
that he might not lose the sight. Of the Composition of the poem he
says, "I wrote it under the bulwark of a vessel off the African coast,
after I had been at sea long enough to appreciate even the fancy of a
gallop on the back of a certain good horse 'York' there in my stable at
home." The poem was written in pencil on the flyleaf of Bartoli's
<i>Simboli</i>, a favorite book of his. Browning says that there was no sort
of historical foundation for the story, but the Pacification of Ghent in
1576 has been suggested as an appropriate background. The incident
narrated could naturally belong to the efforts of the united cities of
Holland, Zealand, and the Southern Netherlands to combat the tyranny of
Philip II.</p>

<p>6. Of this line Miss Barrett wrote: "It drew us out into the night as
witnesses."</p>

<p>13. <i>'Twas moonset.</i> The distance from Ghent to Aix is something over a
hundred miles. The first horse gave out at Hasselt, about eighty miles
from Ghent; the second horse failed at Dalhem in sight of Aix. Roland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
made the whole distance between midnight of one day and sunset of the
next. The minute notes of time are for dramatic and picturesque effect
rather than as exact indications of progress. Even the towns are not
used with the exactness of a guide-book, for Looz and Tongres are off
the direct route.</p>

<p>17. <i>Mecheln.</i> Flemish for Mechlin. The chimes they heard were probably
from the cathedral tower.</p>

<p>41. <i>Dome-spire.</i> Over the polygonal monument founded by Charlemagne in
Aix-la-Chapelle is a dome 104 feet high and 48 feet in diameter. The
reference is probably to this dome.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_76">THE FLOWER'S NAME</a></h3>

<p>This poem and "Sibrandus Schafnaburgensis," a companion poem, appeared
in <i>Hood's Magazine</i>, July, 1844, under the title of "Garden Fancies."
"The Flower's Name" is a description of a garden by a lover whose
conception of its beauty is heightened and made vital by the memories it
enshrines. Of this poem Miss Barrett wrote to Browning, "Then the
'Garden Fancies'&mdash;some of the stanzas about the name of the flower, with
such exquisite music in them, and grace of every kind&mdash;and with that
beautiful and musical use of the word 'meandering,' which I never
remember having seen used in relation to sound before. It does to mate
with your '<i>simmering</i> quiet' in <i>Sordello</i>, which brings the summer air
into the room as sure as you read it." (<i>Letters of R. B. and E. B. B.</i>,
I, 134.)</p>

<p>10. <i>Box.</i> An evergreen shrub, dwarf varieties of which are used for low
hedges or the borders of flower-beds.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_78">MEETING AT NIGHT AND PARTING AT MORNING</a></h3>

<p>These poems were published originally simply as "Night" and "Morning."
The second of these love lyrics is somewhat difficult to interpret. If
the man is speaking, the "him" in l. 3 must refer to the sun. In any
case, after the isolation with the woman he loved as described in the
first poem, there comes with the morning a sense of the world of action
to which the man must return. The two poems are fully discussed in
<i>Poet-Lore</i>, Volume VII, April, May, June-July. The poems are noteworthy
for the fusion of human emotion and natural scenery and for the
startlingly specific phrasing of the first quatrain.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_78">EVELYN HOPE</a></h3>

<p>In this lyric are embodied Browning's faith in personal immortality, his
belief in the permanence of true love and in the value of love though
unrequited in this world.</p>

<p>34. <i>What meant.</i> From this point on through line 52 the lover repeats
what he shall say to Evelyn Hope when in the life to come he claims
her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>


<h3><a href="#Page_81">LOVE AMONG THE RUINS</a></h3>

<p>A man is on his way across the fields to a turret where he is to meet
the girl he loves. As he walks through the solitary pastures he mentally
recreates the powerful life and varied interests of the city which,
tradition has it, once occupied this site, and he seems to be absorbed
in a melancholy recognition of the evanescence of human glory. The girl
is not mentioned till stanza 5. Does the emphasis on the scenery and its
historic associations unduly minimize the love element of the poem? Or
is the whole picture of vanished joy and woe, pride and defeat, but a
background against which stands out more clearly the rapture of the
meeting in the ruined turret?</p>

<p>80. <i>Earth's returns.</i> This phrase refers to the ruins which are all
that now remains of the centuries of folly, noise, and sin. "Them" in l.
81 refers apparently to the "fighters" and the others of the first part
of the stanza.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_84">UP AT A VILLA&mdash;DOWN IN THE CITY</a></h3>

<p>"It is an admirable piece of work crowded with keen descriptions of
Nature in the Casentino, and of life in the streets of Florence. And
every piece of description is so filled with the character of the
'Italian person of quality' who describes them&mdash;a petulant, humorous,
easily angered, happy, observant, ignorant, poor gentleman&mdash;that
Browning entirely disappears. The poem retains for us in its verse, and
indeed in its light rhythm, the childlikeness, the na&iuml;vet&eacute;, the simple
pleasures, the ignorance and the honest boredom with the solitudes of
Nature&mdash;of a whole class of Italians, not only of the time when it was
written, but of the present day. It is a delightful, inventive piece of
gay and pictorial humor." (Stopford Brooke, <i>The Poetry of Browning</i>, p.
322.)</p>

<p>33. <i>Corn.</i> In Great Britain the word is generally applied to wheat,
rye, oats, and barley, not to maize as in America.</p>

<p>34. <i>Stinking hemp.</i> In Chapter I of James Lane Allen's <i>The Reign of
Law</i> is the following passage on the odor of the hemp-field: "And now
borne far through the steaming air floats an odor, balsamic, startling:
the odor of those plumes and stalks and blossoms from which is exuding
freely the narcotic resin of the great nettle." When the long swaths of
cut hemp lies across the field, the smell is represented as strongest,
"impregnating the clothing of the men, spreading far throughout the
air." To many this odor is essentially unpleasant.</p>

<p>42. <i>Pulcinello-trumpet.</i> Pulcinello was originally the clown in the
Neapolitan comedy. Later he became the Punch in Punch and Judy shows.
The trumpet announces that one of these puppet plays is to be given in
the public square.</p>

<p>43. <i>Scene-picture.</i> A picture advertising the new play.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>44. <i>Liberal thieves.</i> Members
of the liberal party, the party striving
for Italian independence. The Person of Quality is, of course, of the
aristocratic party.</p>

<p>47. <i>A sonnet.</i> Laudatory poetical tributes with ornamental borders were
posted in public places as a method of doing homage. In this case the
unknown "Reverend Don So-and-so" is ranked by his admirer with Dante,
Boccaccio, and Petrarch, the greatest Italian poets; with St. Jerome,
one of the most celebrated Fathers of the Latin Church; with Cicero, one
of the greatest of Roman orators; and with St. Paul, the greatest of
Christian preachers.</p>

<p>51. <i>Our Lady.</i> The seven swords represent symbolically the seven
sorrows of the Virgin Mary, but this Person of Quality regards the gilt
swords and the smart pink gowns merely as gay decorations. Religious
processions of the sort described here and in lines 60-64 are frequent
in European countries.</p>

<p>55. <i>It's dear.</i> According to the system of taxation in Italy, town dues
must be paid on all provisions brought into the city.</p>

<p>60. <i>Yellow candles.</i> Used at funerals and in penitential processions in
the Roman Church.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_88">A TOCCATA OF GALUPPI'S</a></h3>

<p>Mrs. Ireland says of this poem: "The Toccata as a form of composition is
not the measured, deliberate working-out of some central musical theme
as is the Sonata or <i>sound</i>-piece. The <i>Toccata</i>, in its early and pure
form, possessed no decided subject, made such by repetition, but bore
rather the form of a capricious Improvisation, or 'Impromptu.'" ("A
Toccata of Galuppi's" by Mrs. Alexander Ireland, published in <i>London
Browning Society Papers</i>.)</p>

<p>1. <i>Galuppi.</i>
<a name="corr6" id="corr6"></a><a class="correction" href="#cn6" title="changed from 'Baldasarre'">Baldassare</a>
Galuppi (1706-1784) was an Italian composer
born near Venice. He spent many years in England and Russia. In 1768 he
became organist at St. Mark's, Venice.</p>

<p>4. <i>Your old music.</i> At the sound of the music Browning imaginatively
re-creates the Venetian social life of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>6. <i>St. Mark's.</i> The great cathedral. The Doge of Venice used to throw a
ring into the sea from the ship <i>Bucentaur</i> to "denote that the Adriatic
was subject to the republic of Venice as a wife is subject to her
husband."</p>

<p>8. <i>Shylock's bridge.</i> The Rialto, a bridge over the Grand Canal. It has
two rows of shops under arcades.</p>

<p>18. <i>Clavichord.</i> An instrument with keys and strings, something like a
piano.</p>

<p>19-30. The musical terms in these lines show Browning's knowledge of the
technicalities of the art. To one without such expert knowledge the
exact musical connotation is doubtless obscure. But the epithets and
phrases are in themselves sufficient to suggest the varying moods of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
the Venetian merrymakers. The plaintiveness, the sighs, the sense of
death, the trembling hope that life may last, the renewed love-making,
the new round of futile pleasures or evil deeds, the end of it all in
the grave, are clearly brought forth. An elaborate explanation of the
musical terms is given in the notes to the Camberwell edition of
Browning's poems.</p>

<p>31. <i>But when I sit down to reason.</i> The first thirty lines of the poem
have recorded the effect of the music in re-creating in the poet's
imagination the gay, careless life of eighteenth century Venice, and its
close in death. Now when the poet endeavors to turn from that picture of
death lurking under smiles, he finds that the cold music has filled his
mind with an inescapable sense of the futility of life, and even his own
chosen mental activities seem to him, along with the rest, hardly more
than dust and ashes. Ambition and enthusiasm fade before the spell of
the music.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_91">OLD PICTURES IN FLORENCE</a></h3>

<p>3. <i>Aloed arch.</i> The genus aloe includes trees, shrubs, and herbs. The
American variety is the century-plant. Browning's hill-side villa
evidently had aloes trained to grow in an arch.</p>

<p>15. <i>The startling bell-tower Giotto raised.</i> Giotto began the Campanile
in 1334, and after his death in 1337 the work was continued by Andrea
Pisano. Its striking beauty impresses the poet as he looks out over the
city. But it does more than that, for it rouses in him reflections on
the progress and meaning of art.</p>

<p>17-24. The address to Giotto, thrown in here as it is with
conversational freedom, is partially explained in lines 184-248. See
note on l. 236.</p>

<p>30. <i>By a gift God grants me.</i> The power to re-create vividly and
minutely the past. The artists of bygone centuries are called back by
his imagination to their old haunts in Florence.</p>

<p>44. <i>Stands One.</i> The "one" (l. 44), "a lion" (l. 47), "the wronged
great soul" (l. 48), and "the wronged great souls" (l. 58), all refer to
the unappreciated early artists.</p>

<p>50. <i>They.</i> That is, the famous great artists such as Michael Angelo and
Raphael. Critics "hum and buzz" around them with praise to which they
are indifferent.</p>

<p>59. <i>Where their work is all to do.</i> Their place in the development of
art is not yet understood. It must be made clear, Browning thinks, that
painters like Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) come in natural succession
from earlier obscure artists like Dello, that art is a real and
continuous record of the human mind and heart.</p>

<p>67. <i>The mastiff girns.</i> When some influential critic snarls, all the
imitative inferior critics take the same tone. Cf. Shelley's "Adonais,"
stanzas 28, 37, 38.</p>

<p>69. <i>Stefano.</i> A pupil of Giotto and called "Nature's ape" because his
accurate representations of the human body.</p>

<p>72. <i>Vasari.</i> Author of <i>Lives of the Most Eminent Painters and</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
<i>Sculptors</i>. (Published 1550. Translated by Mrs. Foster in <i>Bohn's
Library</i>.) In his studies of art Browning made constant use of this
book.</p>

<p>76. <i>Sic transit. Sic transit gloria mundi.</i> "So passes away the glory
of the world."</p>

<p>84. <i>In fructu.</i> "As fruit." The fruit of Greek art at its best was that
it presented in marble ideally perfect human bodies.</p>

<p>98. <i>Theseus.</i> The kingly statue of the reclining Theseus in the frieze
of the Parthenon.</p>

<p>99. <i>Son of Priam.</i> In the sculptures of &AElig;sina, Paris, the son of Priam,
kneeling and drawing his bow, has a grace beyond that of any man who
might think to pose as a model.</p>

<p>101. <i>Apollo.</i> At Delphi Apollo slew an enormous python.</p>

<p>102. <i>Niobe.</i> Through the vengeance of Apollo and Diana, Niobe's seven
sons and seven daughters were all slain. In the Imperial Gallery of
Florence there is a statue of Niobe clasping her last child.</p>

<p>103. <i>The Racer's frieze.</i> In the Parthenon.</p>

<p>104. <i>The dying Alexander.</i> A piece of ancient Greek sculpture at
Florence.</p>

<p>108. <i>To submit is a mortal's duty.</i> The supreme beauty of the statues
led men to content themselves with admiration and imitation.</p>

<p>113. <i>Growth came.</i> New life came to art when men ceased to rest in the
perfect achievement of the past, and found a new realm opened up to them
in representing the subtler activities of the soul. Lines 145-152 state
the ideals that actuated the new art. The reference is to the religious
art of the Italian Renaissance.</p>

<p>115-144. These lines sum up the reasons for the importance of the art
that strives "to bring the invisible full into play" (l. 150). It may be
rough-hewn and faulty; but it is greater and grander than Greek art
because of its greater range, variety, and complexity, and because it
reaches beyond any possible present perfection into eternity.</p>

<p>134. <i>Thy one work ... done at a stroke.</i> Giotto when asked for a proof
of his skill to send to the Pope, drew with one stroke of his brush a
perfect circle, whence the proverb, "Rounder than the O of Giotto."</p>

<p>156. <i>Quiddit.</i> Quibble. The humorous rhyme "did it&mdash;quiddit" is but one
of the many whimsical rhyming effects in the poem. The use of a light,
semi-jocose form to give the greater emphasis to serious subject-matter
is characteristic of Browning. Lowell in "A Fable for Critics" employs
the same device.</p>

<p>161-176. Not Browning's usual attitude. Even this poem is a deification
of progress through effort, not through repose.</p>

<p>178. <i>Art's spring-birth.</i> Nicolo the Pisan and Cimabue lived in the
second half of the thirteenth century. From them to Ghiberti
(1381-1455), who made the famous bronze doors of the Baptistry at
Florence, and Ghirlandajo (1449-1494), a Florentine fresco painter, was
a period in which Browning was especially interested. Mrs. Orr says that
he owned pictures by all the artists mentioned here.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>192. <i>Italian quicklime.</i> Many of the fine old Italian fresco paintings
have been whitewashed over.</p>

<p>198. <i>Dree.</i> The pictures "endure" the doom of captivity. But they might
be ferreted out if the ghosts of the old painters would only indicate
where the lost works are.</p>

<p>201-224. He does not hope to get pictures of the famous Florentine
painters, Bigordi (probably another name for Ghirlandajo), Sandro,
Botticelli, Lippino (son of Fra Lippo Lippi), or Fra Angelico. But he
might hope for better success in finding pieces by the obscure painters
mentioned in lines 205-224. These painters are so described that we know
concerning each one, some characteristic quality or work.</p>

<p>206. <i>Intonaco.</i> The plaster that forms the ground for fresco work.</p>

<p>214. <i>Tempera.</i> A pigment mixed with some vehicle soluble in water
instead of with oil as in oil paintings.</p>

<p>218. <i>Barret.</i> A kind of cap.</p>

<p>230. <i>Zeno.</i> The founder of the sect of Stoics, and hence supposedly not
stirred by "naked High Art."</p>

<p>232. <i>Some clay-cold vile Carlino.</i> Commercial dealers in art are
unmoved by true beauty, but they go into ecstasies over uninspired work
like that of Carlino. (Carlo D&oacute;lci, 1616-1686.)</p>

<p>236. <i>A certain precious little tablet.</i> Mr. Browning wrote to Professor
Corson that this was a lost "Last Supper" praised by Vasari. The stanza
in which this line occurs explains ll. 17-24.</p>

<p>237. <i>Buonarroti.</i> Michael Angelo.</p>

<p>241. <i>San Spirito</i>, etc. "Holy Spirit" and "All Saints," old churches in
Florence.</p>

<p>244. <i>Detur amanti.</i> "Let it be given to the one who loves it."</p>

<p>245. <i>Koh-i-noor.</i> A famous Indian diamond presented to Queen Victoria
in 1850.</p>

<p>246. <i>Jewel of Giamschid.</i> The splendid fabulous ruby of Sultan
Giamschid, sometimes called "The Cup of the Sun" and "The Torch of
Night." Byron ("The Giaour") says that the dark eyes of Leila were
"bright as the jewel of Giamschid." The carbuncle of Giamschid is one of
the treasures sought by the Caliph in Beckford's <i>Caliph Vathek</i>.</p>

<p>246. <i>The Persian Sofi.</i> The Sufi or Sofi is a title or surname of the
Shah of Persia.</p>

<p>249. <i>A certain dotard</i>, etc. Radetsky (1766-1858) was in 1849-1857
governor of the Austrian possessions in Upper Italy. "The worse side of
the Mont St. Gothard" is the Swiss side. "Morello" is a mountain near
Florence. There had been frequent insurrections against Austria, but
they had been fruitless. Browning prophesies the time when there shall
be a great national council (a Witanagemot) by which, when Freedom has
been restored to Florence, a new and vigorous Art shall be brought in.
It will then be perceived that a monarchy nourishes the false and
monstrous in art, and that "Pure Art" must come from the people.</p>

<p>258. <i>The stone of Dante.</i> The stone where Dante used to draw his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span> chair
out to sit. For this and other references in stanza XXXIV see Mrs.
Browning's "Casa Guidi Windows," Part I. In this poem she suggests "a
parliament of the lovers of Italy."</p>

<p>260. <i>Quod videas ante</i>&mdash;"Which you may have seen before."</p>

<p>263. <i>Hated house.</i> The poet hates the rule of the House of Lorraine,
and prefers the days of the painter Orgagna, in the fourteenth century,
when Italy was free.</p>

<p>273. <i>Tuscan.</i> The literary language of Italy and not given to
superlatives such as are indicated by "<i>issimo</i>."</p>

<p>275. <i>Cambuscan:</i> a reference to "The Squire's Tale," left unfinished by
Chaucer.</p>

<p>276. <i>Alt to altissimo.</i> "High to highest."</p>

<p>277. <i>Beccaccia.</i> A woodcock.</p>

<p>281. <i>Shall I be alive.</i> According to Giotto's plan the tower was to
have had a spire fifty braccia or cubits (about 95 feet) high. This
spire has never been built.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_101">"DE GUSTIBUS&mdash;"</a></h3>

<p>The whole phrase is <i>De gustibus non disputandum</i>&mdash;"there is no
disputing about tastes." Browning is writing to a friend who prefers an
English landscape while the poet himself declares in favor of Italy.</p>

<p>2. <i>If our loves remain.</i> If we have a life after death.</p>

<p>4. <i>A cornfield.</i> The picture is a field of wheat with red poppies
scattered through the wheat.</p>

<p>23. <i>Cypress.</i> It is interesting to note how many of the trees, shrubs,
flowers, and fruits in Browning's poems are those of southern Europe.
His poetry of nature is almost as distinctively Italian as Tennyson's is
English. "The Englishman in Italy" is especially rich in vivid,
picturesque details of southern scenes.</p>

<p>36. <i>Liver-wing.</i> The right wing. The shot hit the king in the right
arm.</p>

<p>37. <i>Bourbon.</i> Mr. and Mrs. Browning were rejoicing at any indications
that the people of Italy were awake to revolt against the Bourbons. See
Mrs. Browning's "Casa Guidi Windows" and "First News from Villa Franca"
and Mr. Browning's "<a href="#Page_315">The Italian in England</a>."</p>

<p>40. <i>Queen Mary's saying.</i> For two hundred years Calais had been one of
England's most important possessions. It was taken by the French in
1588, the last year of the reign of Queen Mary. What Queen Mary said of
Calais, Browning says of Italy.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_103">HOME-THOUGHTS FROM ABROAD</a></h3>

<p>Compare the sentiment of this poem with that of <a href="#Page_101">"De Gustibus&mdash;"</a> written
ten years later. In "Home Thoughts from Abroad" we have one of
Browning's rare uses of the scenery of his own country.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>14. <i>That's the wise thrush.</i> The power of these lines in presenting
both the musical and the emotional quality of the bird's song is rivaled
only by Wilson Flagg's "The Bobolink" (quoted in John Burroughs's <i>Birds
and Poets</i>) and Wordsworth's "To the Cuckoo."</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_104">HOME-THOUGHTS FROM THE SEA</a></h3>

<p>This poem and the preceding one express two phases of the poet's love of
country; his affection for the physical beauty of England, and his pride
in her political freedom. In the first poem, he turns, in thought, from
the glowing color of Italy, to the more delicate loveliness of England
in April; in the second poem, he longs to repay the service his country
has rendered him in defeating foreign foes.</p>

<p>"Home-Thoughts from the Sea" was written at the same time and under the
same circumstances as "<a href="#Page_73">How they brought the Good News from Ghent to
Aix</a>." The poet, aboard a vessel coasting along the shore of Africa,
could see to the northwest the Portuguese Cape Vincent, near which, in
1797, England won a naval victory over Spain; southeast of Cape Vincent,
on the Spanish coast, Cadiz Bay, where, in 1796, England defeated the
second Spanish Armada; and southeast of Cadiz Bay, Cape Trafalgar,
where, in 1805, Nelson won a famous victory over the allied fleets of
France and Spain. To the northeast, the poet could see Gibraltar, the
great fortress which England acquired from Spain by the Peace of
Utrecht, 1713.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_105">SAUL</a></h3>

<p>1. <i>Abner.</i> The cousin of Saul and the commander of his army. <i>I Samuel</i>
xiv, 50.</p>

<p>9. <i>Saul and the Spirit.</i> For the conflict between Saul and the evil
spirit, and the refreshment that came to him when David played, see <i>I
Samuel</i> xvi, 14-23.</p>

<p>12. <i>Gracious gold hair.</i> For the personal appearance of David, see <i>I
Samuel</i> xvi, 12, 18; xvii, 42.</p>

<p>12. <i>Those lilies ... blue.</i> Mrs. Coleridge wrote to Mr. Kenyon to know
whether Mr. Browning had any authority for "blue lilies." Mr. Browning
answered, "Lilies are of all colors in Palestine&mdash;one sort is
particularized as <i>white</i> with a dark blue spot and streak&mdash;the water
lily, lotus, which I think I meant, is <i>blue</i> altogether." (<i>Letters of
R. B. and E. B. B.</i>, i, 523, 556.)</p>

<p>31. <i>The king-serpent.</i> Probably the boa-constrictor. In poetry the
characteristic most often attributed to a snake is malignancy. But in
this picture of the serpent lying dormant and waiting for the sloughing
of its old skin in the springtime, when it will come forth with new
beauty and power, the idea presented is that of tremendous force
temporarily in abeyance.</p>

<p>42. <i>Then the tune.</i> The boy, alone in the field, tries all sorts of
experi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>ments in musical attraction on the animals about him. Professor
Albert S. Cook suggests that Browning is here indebted to the Greek
pastoral romance of <i>Daphnis and Chloe</i>. See Smith's translation in the
Bohn edition. The passages read in part as follows: "He ran through all
variations of pastoral melody; he played the tune which the oxen obey,
and which attracts the goats&mdash;that in which the sheep delight.</p>

<p>"He took his pipe from his scrip, and breathed into it very gently. The
goats stood still, merely lifting up their heads. Next he played the
pasture tune, upon which they all put down their heads and began to
graze. Now he produced some notes soft and sweet in tone; at once his
herd lay down. After this he piped in a sharp key, and they ran off to
the woods as if a wolf were in sight." These quotations serve at least
to show how old is the fancy that animals are affected by music.</p>

<p>60. The service enjoined on the men of the House of Levi is described in
<i>I Chronicles</i> xxiii, 24-32.</p>

<p>65. <i>Male-sapphires.</i> The male sapphire exhibits, through some
peculiarity of crystalline structure, a star of bright rays. It is also
known as "the star sapphire" and "the asteriated sapphire." The ruby
shows a clear red light at the center.</p>

<p>76. <i>Locust-flesh.</i> In <i>Leviticus</i>, Chapter xi, are given the laws
concerning "what beasts may and what may not be eaten." See verse 22 for
the rule about locusts. Cf. <i>Matthew</i> iii, 4 for the food of John the
Baptist.</p>

<p>102. <i>The cherubim chariot.</i> The first chapter of <i>Ezekiel</i> seems to be
the source of this picture.</p>

<p>105. <i>Have ye seen</i>, etc. The simile in lines 104-115 could have been
written only by one familiar with mountain regions. Browning knew the
Alps and Apennines. Did David at any time live in a mountainous country?</p>

<p>124. <i>Slow pallid sunsets.</i> Note the character of the similitudes so far
used in describing Saul. In his agony he is like the king-serpent. His
rage is like the earthquake that may tear open the rock but at the same
time sets the gold free. His final release from the evil spirit is
described by the sudden fall of the avalanche from the mountain summit.
The look in his eyes as he comes back to life, yet seeing nothing in
life to desire, is compared to pale autumn sunsets seen over the ocean,
or to slow sunsets seen over a desolate hill country. All the figures
contribute to our impression of Saul's power and majesty.</p>

<p>141. <i>Since my days</i>, etc. Compare this passage with <i><a href="#Page_325">Pippa Passes</a></i>,
Prologue, 104-113.</p>

<p>172. <i>Carouse in the past.</i> This line marks a change in the direction of
David's thought. Up to stanza X it was the glorious past that he had
been urging upon Saul's attention. But now he realizes that true
inspiration comes not so much from a re-living of one's achievements, as
from the thought of the permanence of one's fame and one's deeds.</p>

<p>192. <i>And behold while I sang.</i> At this point David is overcome by the
memory of the sudden spiritual illumination that came to him in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
interview with Saul. He had reached the summit of his endeavor (l. 191)
and yet knew himself powerless to give the King new life. Then there
flashed upon him the truth expressed in stanzas XVII-XIX. He breaks off
in lines 192-205, going, in his strong feeling, ahead of his story and
commenting on what is described in stanza XIX. In stanza XV he resumes
his narrative.</p>

<p>204. <i>Hebron.</i> David watches the slow coming of the dawn over the hill
on which is situated the town of Hebron.</p>

<p>205. <i>Kidron.</i> A brook near Jerusalem. It is fed by springs, and the
amount of water in it is sensibly decreased by the extreme heat of the
day.</p>

<p>214. <i>Ere error had bent.</i> In <i>I Samuel</i>, Chapter xv, is an account of
Saul's disobedience and punishment. The choosing of Saul to be king is
described in <i>I Samuel</i>, Chapters ix and x.</p>

<p>292. <i>Sabaoth.</i> The word means "hosts" and is ordinarily used in the
phrase "The Lord of hosts." It represents the omnipotence of God.</p>

<p>303. <i>Nor leave up nor down</i>, etc. At the end of stanza xv, the thought
that had come to David was that God had proved supreme in all the ways
in which a human being could test knowledge and power, but that in the
one way of love the creature might surpass the Creator. At line 302 he
has come to believe in the infinitude of God's love as well as in the
infinitude of His power. It is interesting to note that George Eliot in
<i>Silas Marner</i> gives to ignorant Dolly Winthrop an experience and a
philosophy of life almost identical with those of Browning's David.</p>

<p>307-312. A prophecy of the revelation of the divine in the human, the
coming of God in the person of Christ. It is the human in the divine
that men seek and love. In the Old Testament days such an idea, though
foretold and longed for, could be but vaguely conceived except in
moments of especial insight in the minds of poet-prophets like David.
Mr. Herford (<i>Robert Browning</i>, p. 120) says of this passage:</p>

<p>"David is occupied with no speculative question, but with the practical
problem of saving a ruined soul; and neither logical ingenuity nor
divine suggestion, but the inherent spiritual significance of the
situation, urges his thought along the lonely path of prophecy. The love
for the old King, which prompted him to try all the hidden paths of his
soul in quest of healing, becomes a lighted torch by which he tracks out
the meaning of the world and the still unrevealed purposes of God; until
the energy of thought culminates in vision and the Christ stands full
before his eyes."</p>

<p>313-335. In this stanza David represents all existences, good and evil
spirits, all animals, all forms of nature, as stirred by the great news
of the future manifestation of the love of God as shown in Christ.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_126">MY STAR</a></h3>

<p>A love lyric generally supposed to refer to Mrs. Browning.</p>

<p>4. <i>The angled spar.</i> A prism. In looking at a prism the colors one sees
are determined by the point of view. The idea of the poem is amplified
in "<a href="#Page_239">One Word More</a>," stanzas xvi-xviii.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>


<h3><a href="#Page_126">TWO IN THE CAMPAGNA</a></h3>

<p>The Campagna, a plain around the city of Rome, was in ancient times the
seat of many cities; it is now dotted with ruins. "There is a solemnity
and beauty about the Campagna entirely its own. To the reflective mind,
this ghost of old Rome is full of suggestion; its vast, almost limitless
extent as it seems to the traveler; its abundant herbage and floral
wealth in early spring; its desolation, its crumbling monuments, and its
evidences of a vanished civilization, fill the mind with a sweet
sadness, which readily awakens the longing for the infinite spoken of in
the poem." (Berdoe, <i>Browning Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, p. 553.)</p>

<p>6. <i>I touched a thought.</i> The elusive thought which he fancifully
pursues from point to point in the surrounding landscape finds statement
in lines 34-60. Of these lines Sharp (<i>Life of Browning</i>, p. 159) says,
"There is a gulf which not the profoundest search can fathom, which not
the strongest-winged love can overreach: the gulf of individuality. It
is those who have loved most deeply who recognize most acutely this
always pathetic and often terrifying isolation of the soul. None save
the weak can believe in the absolute union of two spirits ... No man, no
poet assuredly, could love as Browning loved, and fail to be aware,
often with vague anger and bitterness, no doubt, of this insuperable
isolation even when spirit seemed to leap to spirit, in the touch of a
kiss, in the evanishing sigh of some one or other exquisite moment."</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_129">IN THREE DAYS</a></h3>

<p>"Another poem of waiting love is 'In Three Days.' And this has the
spirit of a true love lyric in it. It reads like a personal thing; it
breathes exaltation; it is quick, hurried, and thrilled. The delicate
fears of chance and changes in the three days, or in the years to come,
belong of right and nature to the waiting, and are subtly varied and
condensed. It is, however, the thoughtful love of a man who can be
metaphysical in love." (Stopford Brooke, <i>The Poetry of Robert
Browning</i>, p. 253.)</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_130">THE GUARDIAN ANGEL</a></h3>

<p><i>Fano.</i> This poem was written in the summer of 1848 after a visit of
three days at Fano. It is addressed to Alfred Domett, one of Browning's
warm friends, who was at that time in New Zealand on the Wairoa River.
For a vivid description of him see Browning's "Waring." The picture at
Fano, the details of which are fully brought out in the poem, has been
reproduced in <i>Illustrations to Browning's Poems</i>, Part I, published by
the Browning Society. Mrs. Browning (<i>Letters</i> i, 380) speaks of it as
"a divine picture of Guercino's worth going all that way to see."</p>

<p>6. <i>Another child for tending.</i> With a longing for guidance and
protection Browning imagines himself as a child under the guardianship
of the angel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>16. <i>Like that child.</i> The child in the picture looks into the heavens.
Browning would look only at the gracious face of the angel.</p>

<p>46. <i>My angel.</i> Cf. "My love," l. 54. Both refer to Mrs. Browning.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_132">MEMORABILIA</a></h3>

<p><i>Pauline</i> (1832) has many references to Shelley; note especially lines
151-229; 1020-1031. Browning's "Essay on Shelley" appeared in 1852.
"Memorabilia" was composed in 1853-4.</p>

<p>18-28. That later in life Browning "came to think unfavorably of Shelley
as a man and to esteem him less highly as a poet" is shown by a letter
written to Dr. Furnivall: "For myself I painfully contrast my notions of
Shelley the <i>man</i> and Shelley, well, even the <i>poet</i>, with what they
were sixty years ago." (Quoted by Mr. Dowden: <i>Robert Browning</i>, p. 10.)
Mr. Browning declined an invitation to be president of the Shelley
Society. For a discussion of Shelley's influence on Browning see
<i>Poet-Lore</i>, Volume VII, January, 1895.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_133">INCIDENT OF THE FRENCH CAMP</a></h3>

<p>Ratisbon, a city of Bavaria, was stormed by Napoleon in 1809. The story
told in the poem is a true one, but its hero was a man, not a boy.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_135">MY LAST DUCHESS</a></h3>

<p>The original title in <i>Dramatic Lyrics</i>, 1842, was "Italy." It is a poem
of the Italian Renaissance. Fr&agrave; Pandolf and Claus of Innsbruck are,
however, imaginary artists.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_137">THE BOY AND THE ANGEL</a></h3>

<p>There is no known original for the story of Theocrite, but it is in
accord with the Roman Catholic belief that angels watch over human
beings and are interested in their affairs. In the last line is the
fundamental lesson of the poem. Compare the thought of Pippa in the song
"All service ranks the same with God." See Leigh Hunt's "King Robert of
Sicily" (in <i>A Jar of Honey</i>, ch. vi.) and Longfellow's "King Robert of
Sicily" (in <i>Tales of a Wayside Inn</i>) for an analogous legend.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_141">THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN</a></h3>

<p>This poem was written to amuse little Willie Macready who was ill and
wished a poem for which he could make illustrations. There are many
legends that deal with the refusal of a reward promised to a magician
for some stipulated service. Mr. Berdoe (<i>Browning Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, p. 339)
says that the story given here is based on an account by Verstegan in
his <i>Restitution of Decayed Intelligence</i> (1634). Verstegan gives
"Bunting" as the name of the piper; the town, as Hamelin in Brunswick on
the Weser; and the mountain into which the children were led as the
K&ouml;ppenberg.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>


<h3><a href="#Page_152">THE FLIGHT OF THE DUCHESS</a></h3>

<p>When Mr. Browning was little more than a child he heard a woman one Guy
Fawkes's Day sing, in the street a strange song whose burden was
"Following the Queen of the Gypsies, O!" The singular refrain haunted
his memory for many years, and out of it was ultimately born this poem.</p>

<p>6-31. The Duke's medieval castle was apparently in Northern Germany,
near the sea.</p>

<p>78. <i>Rough-foot merlin.</i> A species of hawk formerly trained to pursue
other birds and game. A "falcon-lanner" is a long-tailed hawk. The word,
when used in falconry, is restricted to the female hawk, which is larger
than the male.</p>

<p>101. <i>Struck at himself.</i> Amazed at his own importance.</p>

<p>130. <i>Urochs.</i> The aurochs, the European bison, a species nearly extinct
but preserved in the forests of Lithuania and the Caucasus. The "buffle"
is the buffalo.</p>

<p>135-153. Compare this lady with the one in "<a href="#Page_135">My Last Duchess</a>."</p>

<p>216. <i>Well, early in autumn.</i> In writing "The Flight of the Duchess"
Browning was interrupted by a friend on some important business which
temporarily drove the story out of the poet's mind. Some months after
the publication of the first part in <i>Hood's Magazine</i>, April, 1845, he
was staying at Bettisfield Park in Shropshire when someone in commenting
on the early approach of winter said that already the deer had to break
the ice in the pond. This chance phrase roused the poet's fancy, and
when he returned home he completed his poem.</p>

<p>238. <i>St. Hubert.</i> Before his conversion St. Hubert had been
passionately fond of hunting; hence he became the patron saint of
hunters.</p>

<p>240-247. "The jerkin" or short coat; the "trunk-hose," or full breeches
extending from the waist to the middle of the thigh; the big rimless
hats with broad projections back and front and highly ornamented, were
medieval articles of attire revived by the Duke for his "Middle Age"
hunting party.</p>

<p>249. <i>Venerers, Prickers, and Verderers</i> are ancient names for huntsmen,
horsemen, and preservers of venison.</p>

<p>263. <i>Horns wind a mort.</i> Horns announce the death of the stag; "at
siege" probably means "brought to the appointed station." Possibly it
means "at bay," in which case "wind a mort" must mean "announce that the
death of the stag is imminent."</p>

<p>264. <i>Prick forth.</i> Spur her horse forth. She was to ride a jennet, a
small Spanish horse known in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>315. <i>Quince-tinct.</i> Tincture of quince was used as a cosmetic.</p>

<p>322. <i>Fifty-part canon.</i> "Mr. Browning explained that a 'canon, in
music, is a piece wherein the subject is repeated in various keys, and
being strictly obeyed in the repetition, becomes the canon, the
imperative law to what follows.' Fifty of such parts would be indeed a
notable peal; to manage three is enough of an achievement for a good
musician." Berdoe, <i>Browning Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>: page 180.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>480. <i>The band-roll.</i> Her head was ornamented with a band on which were
strung Persian coins.</p>

<p>533. <i>Gor-crow's flappers.</i> Wings of carrion crow.</p>

<p>581. <i>Like the spots.</i> Effects of phosphorescence.</p>

<p>845. <i>I have seen my little lady.</i> It is not clear where or when he saw
her. Possibly he refers only to his revived memory of her.</p>

<p>852. <i>And ... floats me.</i> This construction is what is known as the
"ethical dative." The old servant merely says in jocose fashion that
telling his story has made his blood course more rapidly and freely.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_183">A GRAMMARIAN'S FUNERAL</a></h3>

<p><i>The Revival of Learning.</i> The Revival of Learning, or the Renaissance,
began as early as the tenth century. Its period of most rapid progress
was from the twelfth century to the fifteenth. One phase of the interest
in the revival of learning was the effort to restore Latin to its
ancient purity. The word "grammarian" was more widely inclusive than
now, meaning one who devoted himself to general learning. Of this poem
Dr. Burton in "Renaissance Pictures in Browning" (<i>Poet-Lore</i>, Vol. x,
pp. 60-76, No. 1, 1898) says: "I know of no lyric of the poet's more
representative of his peculiar and virile strength than this, in that it
makes vibrant and thoroughly emotional an apparently unemotional theme.
In relation to the Renaissance, the revival of learning, the moral is
the higher inspiration derived from the new wine of the classics, so
that what in later times has cooled down too often to a dry-as-dust
study of the husks of knowledge is shown to be, at the start, a
veritable reveling in the delights of the fruit."</p>

<p>Mr. Stopford Brooke in <i>The Poetry of Browning</i>, p. 155, says, "This is
the artist at work, and I doubt whether all the laborious prose written,
in history and criticism, on the revival of learning, will ever express
better than this short poem the inexhaustible thirst of the Renaissance
in its pursuit of knowledge, or the enthusiasm of the pupils of a New
Scholar for his desperate strife to know in a short life the very center
of the universe."</p>

<p>3. <i>Leave we the common crofts.</i> As the procession starts up the hill
they leave behind them the small farms and little villages of the plain.</p>

<p>8. <i>Rock-row.</i> Day is just breaking over the rocky summits of the
mountains.</p>

<p>9. <i>There, man's thought.</i> The smoking crater of a volcano, described as
a censer from which rise the fumes of incense, portends an outbreak of
subterranean fire. The speaker fancifully considers this an appropriate
spot in which to bury the scholar whose passionate eagerness of thought
chafed continually against the bounds of custom and ignorance and human
weakness.</p>

<p>14. <i>Sepulture.</i> Pronounced here, <i>sep&uacute;lture</i>. A burial place or tomb.</p>

<p>25. <i>Step to a tune.</i> Here and in various other places, as lines 41, 73,
76, etc., are directions to the pallbearers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>34. <i>Lyric Apollo.</i> The god Apollo was the ideal of manly beauty. The
Grammarian was, it seems, endowed with rare charm of face and form.</p>

<p>35. <i>Long he lived nameless.</i> Youth had passed before the Grammarian
really entered upon his quest for knowledge. But he did not despair. His
vanishing of youth was but a signal to "leave play for work."</p>

<p>45. <i>Grappled with the world.</i> The world of knowledge, especially
ancient learning, which was recovered slowly and with difficulty.</p>

<p>49. <i>Theirs.</i> He wishes to study the "shaping" or writings of poets and
sages.</p>

<p>50. <i>Gowned.</i> Put on the scholastic gown.</p>

<p>64. <i>Queasy.</i> Sick at the stomach. He could not get knowledge enough to
make him feel a distaste for it.</p>

<p>65-68. "It" in l. 66 refers to l. 67. The "it" in l. 68 refers to "such
a life," l. 65.</p>

<p>70. <i>Fancy the fabric.</i> Under the figure of making a complete plan
before beginning to build a house, he describes the Grammarian's purpose
to know the whole scheme of life before he lived out any part of it.</p>

<p>86. <i>Calculus</i> and <i>tussis</i> (l. 88) are diseases, the stone and
bronchitis, that attacked him.</p>

<p>95. <i>Soul-hydroptic.</i> "Hydroptic" is a rare word for "thirsty."</p>

<p>103. <i>God's task</i>, etc. He neglected the body, magnified the mind, and
believed that the full realization of his aspirations would come in "the
heavenly period."</p>

<p>113. <i>That low man</i>. This comparison between the "low man" and the "high
man" could be effectively illustrated from "Andrea del Sarto." Andrea is
the "low man" who with his skillful hand "goes on adding one to one"
till he attains his "hundred," or excellence of technique. But the other
painters, the ones with the "truer light of God" in them, reach the
heaven above and take their place there although what they see
transcends the power of their art to tell. They miss the "unit" of an
adequate technique, but they gain the "million" of spiritual insight.</p>

<p>129. <i>Hoti ... Oun ... De.</i> Points in Greek grammar concerning which
there was much learned discussion.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_189">"CHILDE ROLAND TO THE DARK TOWER CAME"</a></h3>

<p>Mrs. Orr (<i>Handbook of Browning's Works</i>, p. 274) says of this poem: "We
can connect no idea of definite pursuit or attainment with a series of
facts so dream-like and so disjointed: still less extract from it a
definite moral; and we are reduced to taking the poem as a simple work
of fancy, built up of picturesque impressions which have, separately or
collectively, produced themselves in the author's mind." And she adds in
a note: "I may venture to state that these picturesque materials
included a tower which Mr. Browning once saw in the Carrara Mountains, a
painting which caught his eye years later in Paris; and the figure of a
horse in the tapestry in his own drawing-room&mdash;welded together in the
remembrance of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span> line from '<i>King Lear</i>,' which forms the heading of
the poem." The possible allegorical signification of the poem has been
the subject of much, and often of singularly futile discussion. Dr.
Furnivall said he had asked Browning if it was an allegory, and in
answer had on three separate occasions received an emphatic statement
that it was simply a dramatic creation called forth by a line of
Shakspere's. (Porter-Clarke, <i>Study Programmes</i>, p. 406.) Yet
allegorical interpretations continue to be made. According to one line
of interpretation the pilgrim is a "truth-seeker, misdirected by the
lying spirit" (the hoary cripple), and when he blows the slug-horn it is
as a warning to others that he has failed in his quest, and that the way
to the dark tower is the way of destruction and death. (Berdoe,
<i>Browning Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, p. 105) According to other readings of the tale
the blast which the pilgrim blows at the end of his quest is one of
"spiritual victory and incitement to others." When the Rev. John S.
Chadwick visited the poet and asked him if constancy to an ideal&mdash;"He
that endureth to the end shall be saved"&mdash;was not a sufficient
understanding of the central purpose of the poem, Browning said: "Yes,
just about that." With constancy to an ideal as the central purpose, the
details of this poem, without being minutely interpreted, may yet serve
as a representation of the depression, the hopelessness, the dullness
and deadness of soul, the doubt and terror even of the man who travels
the last stages of a difficult journey to a long-sought but unknown
goal. His victory consists in the unfaltering persistence of his search.
The "squat tower," when he reaches it, is prosaic and ugly, but finding
it is after all not the essential point. The essential element of his
success is that, encircled by the last temptations to despair, he holds
heart and brain steady, and carries out his quest to its last detail.
(See an article in <i>The Critic</i>, May 3, 1886, by Mr. Arlo Bates, in
opposition to any definite allegory. Mr. Nettleship in <i>Robert Browning</i>
[p. 89] devotes a chapter to a paraphrase and an allegorical
explanation.)</p>

<p>Mr. Herford (<i>Life of Browning</i>, p. 94) calls the poem "a great romantic
legend" and emphasizes its intensity and boldness of invention. He
compares its "horror-world" with that of Coleridge in "The Ancient
Mariner." "What 'The Ancient Mariner' is in the poetry of the mysterious
terrors and splendors of the sea, that 'Childe Roland' is in the poetry
of bodeful horror, of haunted desolation, of waste and plague, ragged
distortion, and rotting ugliness in landscape. The Childe, like the
Mariner, advances through an atmosphere and scenery of steadily
gathering menace."</p>

<p>Mr. Chesterton says of the scenery: "It is ... the poetry of the shabby
and hungry aspect of the earth itself. Daring poets who wished to escape
from the conventional gardens and orchards had long been in the habit of
celebrating the poetry of rugged and gloomy landscapes, but Browning is
not content with this. He insists on celebrating the poetry of mean
landscapes. That sense of scrubbiness in nature, as of a man unshaved,
had never been conveyed with this enthusiasm and primeval gusto before."
(<i>Robert Browning</i>, p. 159.)</p>

<h3><a href="#Page_196">HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY</a></h3>

<p>This poem is the story of an obscure poet in the Spanish city of
Valladolid. It brings out his actual life and the townfolk's
misinterpretations of it. Reports multiply upon themselves and take new
meanings till the harmless poet is generally accounted the King's spy
and the real agent of all royal edicts, the town's master, in fact. The
interest which, as a poet, he takes in all manifestations of life is
popularly supposed to be the alertness of a secret agent of the
government. The reams of poetry he writes are transformed into letters
of information to the King. Rumor translates the poet's perfectly
decent, regular, meager life into secret sybaritic extravagances.</p>

<p>7. <i>Though none did.</i> His suit had once been fashionable, but, though
still serviceable, was of a sort no longer worn by his fellow townsmen.</p>

<p>25. <i>The coffee-roaster's brazier.</i> The coffee is roasted in a dish that
is made to revolve over the coals in an open pan or basin.</p>

<p>74. <i>Beyond the Jewry.</i> Beyond the Jew's quarter, a squalid portion of
the city.</p>

<p>90. <i>The Corregidor.</i> The Spanish title for a magistrate.</p>

<p>104. <i>Here had been.</i> The poet, misconceived by his generation, poor,
and lonely, has yet a great spiritual personality. Men see the old coat.
God, the King for whom he works, sees his real nature; hence heavenly
guards attend when this man comes to die.</p>

<p>115. <i>The Prado.</i> The chief fashionable promenade of Madrid.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_200">FRA LIPPO LIPPI</a></h3>

<p>Fra Lippo Lippi was born in Florence in 1406. See Vasari's <i>Lives of the
Painters</i> for the account of his life on which Browning based his poem.
(Vasari's account is quoted in Cooke's <i>Browning Guide Book</i>.)</p>

<p>2. <i>You need not clap your torches.</i> Throughout this lively dramatic
monologue it is important to mark every indication of the words or
gestures of the auditors; for instance, in lines 13, 18, 26, etc.</p>

<p>7. <i>The Carmine.</i> Fra Lippo Lippi's entrance into the monastery of the
friars del Carmine and his education there are described later in the
poem. He lived there till he was twenty-six. He had no vocation for the
life of a monk and wished to devote himself to painting. He apparently
left the monastery on good terms with the friars.</p>

<p>17. <i>Master&mdash;a Cosimo of the Medici.</i> Cosimo de Medici (1389-1464) was a
rich Florentine banker and statesman. He was a magnificent patron of art
and literature. The old Medici palace (l. 17), now known as <i>Palazzo
Riccardi</i>, is on the corner of the <i>Via Cavour</i> and the <i>Via Gori</i>. The
church of <i>San Lorenzo</i> (the "Saint Laurence" of l. 67) is a short
distance farther west on the Via Gori.</p>

<p>22. <i>Pick up a manner</i>. The painter protests against the rough usage to
which he has been subjected.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>23. <i>Zooks.</i> An interjection formerly written "gadzooks." <i>Pilchards</i>
are a common cheap fish of the Mediterranean and are taken in seines.</p>

<p>28. <i>Quarter-florin.</i> The florin was a gold coin of Florence. It was
first struck off in the twelfth century and was called a florin because
it had a flower stamped on one side.</p>

<p>31. <i>I'd like his face.</i> The painter cannot look upon the crowd of men
about him without seeing faces he would like to draw. One man would do
as a model for Judas. Another would do well in a picture Fra Lippo's
imagination quickly conjures up of a slave holding the head of John the
Baptist by the hair. In Fra Lippo's real picture of the beheading of
John the Baptist the head is brought in by Salome, the daughter of
Herodias, on a great platter.</p>

<p>46. <i>Carnival.</i> The days preceding Lent. A period marked by much gaiety,
street revelry, masking, etc.</p>

<p>53. <i>Flower o' the broom.</i> These flower songs, called <i>stornelli</i>, are
improvised by the peasants at their work. "The <i>stornelli</i> consists of
three lines. The first line usually contains the name of a flower which
sets the rhyme and is five syllables long. Then the love theme is told
in two lines of eleven syllables each, agreeing by rhyme, assonance, or
repetition with the first." (Porter and Clarke note in Camberwell
Edition.) Browning does not follow the model strictly.</p>

<p>73. <i>Jerome.</i> St. Jerome was one of the Fathers of the Christian Church.
During a part of his early life he was given up to worldly pleasures,
and for this he did penance by living for a number of years in a cave in
a desert region. The penitent St. Jerome was a popular devotional
subject in early Christian art. "The scene is generally a wild rocky
solitude; St. Jerome, half-naked, emaciated, with matted hair and beard,
is seen on his knees before a crucifix, beating his breast with a
stone." (Mrs. Jameson, <i>Sacred and Legendary Art</i>, i, 308.)</p>

<p>80. <i>What am I a beast for?</i> If you had happened, says Fra Lippo, to
catch Cosimo in a frolic like this, of course you would have said
nothing; but you think a monk is a beast if he indulges in these
nocturnal pleasures. Yet why should the fact that I break monastic rules
make you consider me a beast? Just let me tell you how I happened to
become a monk.</p>

<p>83. <i>I starved there.</i> Note the vivid picture of the life of a street
gamin here and in lines 112-126.</p>

<p>88. <i>Aunt Lapaccia.</i> Vasari says, "The child was for some time under the
care of a certain Mona Lapaccia, his aunt, who brought him up with very
great difficulty till he had attained his eighth year, when, being no
longer able to support the burden of his maintenance, she placed him in
the above-named convent of the Carmelites." "Trussed," means "firmly
seized."</p>

<p>117. <i>Which gentlemen</i>, etc. Gentlemen clad in fine ecclesiastical robes
walk in the religious procession and carry tall wax candles or torches;
the drippings from these candles the street-urchin wishes to catch in
order to sell them again, but it is against the law, and the fine
gentlemen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span> if not kindly disposed may call in the magistrates ("The
Eight") and have the boy whipped.</p>

<p>130. <i>The antiphonary's marge.</i> He scrawled his sketches on the margins
of the book used by the choir, and he made faces out of the notes, which
were then square with long stems.</p>

<p>139. <i>We Carmelites.</i> The three orders of monks, the Carmelites, the
Camaldolese, and the Dominicans (called "Preaching Brothers" by Pope
Innocent III) owned various monasteries and churches, and were each
ambitious to possess the greatest sacred paintings.</p>

<p>145-163. These lines describe the different figures painted on the wall
by Fra Lippo when the prior bade him "daub away." The monks dressed in
black or white according to the garb of their orders; the old women
waiting to confess small thefts; the row of admiring little children
gazing at a bearded fellow, a murderer who, still breathing hard with
the run that has brought him in safety to the altar steps, defies the
"white anger" of his victim's son, who has followed him into the church;
the girl who loves the brute of a murderer, and brings him flowers,
food, and her earrings to aid him when he shall escape&mdash;all these are
painted on the wall. Then the young artist took down the ladder by means
of which he had reached the bit of cloister-wall where he had been
recording his observations of life, and called the monks to see.</p>

<p>156. <i>Whose sad face.</i> The purpose of Christ's suffering ("passion") on
the cross was to bring love into the world, but after a thousand years
of his teaching his image looks down upon theft, anger, murder.</p>

<p>172. <i>My triumph's straw-fire.</i> Lippo's triumph was as short-lived as a
fire of straw. The monks were delighted with the realism of the
painting, but when the Prior and the critics came they declared that
such "homage to the perishable clay" was a mere "devil's game." The
business of the painter, they said, was to ignore the body and paint the
soul.</p>

<p>184. <i>Man's soul.</i> Note the difficulty the Prior experiences when he
tries to describe the "soul" he wishes the artist to paint. Lines
185-186 represent an old superstition.</p>

<p>189-198. In contrast to the homely realism of Fra Lippo's picture of
ordinary people are the idealism, the religious symbolism, of the
pictures of Giotto, a painter a century and a half earlier than Fra
Lippo, and the greatest master of the early school of Italian art.</p>

<p>198-214. An exposition of Fra Lippo's idea of painting. He says that it
is nonsense to ignore the body in order to make the soul pre&euml;minent,
that the painter should go a "double step" and paint both body and soul.
He may make the face of a girl as lovely and life-like as possible, and
at the same time show her soul in her face.</p>

<p>215-220. A defense of the value of beauty for its own sake. Cf. Keats,
"Ode to a Grecian Urn," and the beginning of his "Endymion." Fra Lippo
Lippi has been long out of convent limitations, but he cannot forget how
certain the monks were that he had chosen the wrong path, and that he
could never equal the great painter, Fra Angelico (1389-1455), who,
kneeling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span> in adoration, painted lovely saints and angels, nor even
Lorenzo Monaca, a Florentine painter with the same tendencies as
Angelico.</p>

<p>257. <i>Out at grass.</i> <i>Grass</i> in this passage stands for enjoyment of
life as opposed to asceticism.</p>

<p>276. <i>Guidi.</i> Tommaso Guidi, ordinarily known as Masaccio, or
Tomassacio, Slovenly or Hulking Tom. Browning followed good authority in
making Masaccio a pupil of Fra Lippo Lippi, but in point of fact he was
probably the master whose works Fra Lippo studied. L&uuml;bke (<i>History of
Art</i> ii, 207) says of Guidi: "In his exceedingly short life he rapidly
traversed the various stages of development of earlier art, and pressed
on with a bold confidence to a greatness and power of vision which have
rendered his works the characteristic ones of an epoch, and his example
a decisive influence in all the art of the fifteenth century.... Almost
every master in the fifteenth century ... studied these great works and
learned from them. One of the first of these masters was Fra Lippo
Lippi." The important point is that Fra Lippo and Masaccio were both
pioneers in the new art which took infinite pains in the representation
of the body. Masaccio is said to have been the first Italian artist to
paint a nude figure.</p>

<p>323. <i>A Saint Laurence ... at Prato.</i> Prato a town near Florence,
attracted many artists in the fifteenth century, so that one finds there
many specimens of Early Renaissance painting. Some of the most important
of Fra Lippo Lippi's large works are in the Cathedral at Prato.</p>

<p>326-334. The people have been so enraged at the slaves who are pictured
as assisting in the martyrdom of St. Laurence that the faces of these
slaves have been scratched from the wall. The monks think the picture a
huge success because it has thus roused religious zeal.</p>

<p>339. <i>Chianti wine.</i> A famous wine named from Chianti, a mountain group
near Siena, Italy.</p>

<p>346. <i>Sant Ambrogio's.</i> The picture described here is the "Coronation of
the Virgin" now in the <i>Accademia delle Belle Arti</i> of Florence. <i>Sant'
Ambrogio</i> is a Florentine church named after St. Ambrose, a Bishop of
Milan.</p>

<p>354. <i>St. John.</i> The Baptist. Note the reference to camel's hair raiment
in l. 375. <i>The Battistero</i>, the original cathedral of Florence, was
dedicated to John the Baptist. Some say the reliefs on one of its famous
bronze doors represent scenes from his life. To this church all children
born in Florence are brought to be baptized.</p>

<p>357. <i>Job.</i> See <i>Job</i> i, 1.</p>

<p>360. <i>Up shall come.</i> Artists not infrequently painted their own
portraits in their pictures. In the "Coronation of the Virgin" Fra
Lippo's round tonsured head is seen in the lower right hand corner.</p>

<p>377. <i>Iste perfecit opus.</i> "This one did the work."</p>

<p>381. <i>Hot cockles.</i> An old English game in which a blind-folded player
tries to guess the names of those who touch or strike him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>


<h3><a href="#Page_213">ANDREA DEL SARTO</a></h3>

<p>Andrea del Sarto's father was a tailor (<i>Sarto</i>) and so the son was
nicknamed "The Tailor's Andrew." He was born in 1486. His first
paintings were seven frescoes in the Church of the Annunziata in
Florence. They were "marvelous productions for a youth who was little
over twenty, and remain Andrea's most charming and attractive works."
(Julia Cartwright, <i>The Painters of Florence</i>.) Algernon Charles
Swinburne in <i>Essays and Studies</i> ("Notes and Designs on the Old Masters
at Florence") says of Andrea's early paintings in comparison with his
later work: "These are the first fruits of his flowering manhood, when
the bright and buoyant genius in him had free play and large delight in
its handiwork; when the fresh interest of invention was still his, and
the dramatic sense, the pleasure in the play of life, the power of
motion and variety; before the old strength of sight and of flight had
passed from weary wing and clouding eye, the old pride and energy of
enjoyment had gone out of hand and heart.</p>

<p>"How the change fell upon him, and how it wrought, anyone may see who
compares his later with his earlier work.... The time came when another
than Salome [referring to Andrea del Sarto's picture of Salome dancing
before Herod] was to dance before the eyes of the painter; and she
required of him the head of no man, but his own soul; and he paid the
forfeit into her hands.... In Mr. Browning's noblest poem&mdash;his noblest,
it seems to me&mdash;the whole tragedy is distilled into the right words, the
whole man raised up and reclothed with flesh. One point only is but
lightly touched upon&mdash;missed it could not be by an eye so sharp and
skillful&mdash;the effect upon his art of the poisonous solvent of love. How
his life was corroded by it, and his soul burnt into dead ashes we are
shown in full, but we are not shown in full what as a painter he was
before, what as a painter he might have been without it."</p>

<p>The bare facts of this poem are taken from Vasari's <i>Lives of the
Painters</i>. Vasari, once a pupil of Andrea del Sarto, hated Lucrezia and
in his account spared no details of her evil influence. Later chronicles
give a somewhat more favorable view of her, but the main facts of the
story remain undisputed. Of the origin of the poem, Mrs. Andrew Crosse
(see "John Kenyon and His Friends" in <i>Temple Bar Magazine</i>, April,
1900) writes; "When the Brownings were living in Florence, Kenyon had
begged them to procure him a copy of the portrait in the Pitti of Andrea
del Sarto and his wife. Mr. Browning was unable to get the copy made
with any promise of satisfaction, and so wrote the exquisite poem of
Andrea del Sarto&mdash;and sent it to Kenyon!" For another literary
presentation of Andrea del Sarto see <i>Andre del Sarto</i>, a play by Alfred
de Musset.</p>

<p>15. <i>Fiesole</i>. A town on a hill above the Arno about three miles
northwest of Florence. See <i><a href="#Page_325">Pippa Passes</a></i>.</p>

<p>40. <i>We are in God's hand.</i> Andrea's fatalistic view of life aids him in
escaping the poignancy of remorse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>65. <i>The Legate's talk.</i> The representative of the Pope praised Andrea's
work. For the high esteem accorded Andrea when he was in Paris at the
court of Francis I, see lines 149-161.</p>

<p>82. <i>This low-pulsed forthright craftsman's hand.</i> Eugene Muntz (quoted
in <i>Masters of Art</i> series, in the number entitled "Andrea del Sarto")
says of Andrea's skill: "No painter has excelled him in the rendering of
flesh.... No painter, moreover, has surpassed him in his grasp of the
infinite resources of the palette. All the secrets of richness,
softness, and <i>morbidenza</i>, all the mysteries of <i>pastoso</i> and <i>sfumato</i>
were his. It is not then as a technician that we must deny Andrea del
Sarto the right to rank with the very greatest. It is as an artist
(using the word in its highest sense) that he falls below them, for he
was lacking in the loftier qualities of imagination, sentiment, and,
worst of all, conviction." <i>Histoire de l'Art pendent la Renaissance</i>.</p>

<p>93. <i>Morello</i>. A mountain of the Apennines and visible from Florence.</p>

<p>98. <i>Or what's a heaven for.</i> According to Browning's theory, perfection
gained and rested in means stagnation. Aspiration toward the
unattainable is the condition of growth. The artist who can satisfy
himself with such themes as can be completely expressed by his art, is
on a low level of experience and attainment.</p>

<p>105. <i>The Urbinate.</i> Raphael Sanzio of Urbino, one of the greatest of
Italian painters. He died in 1520; hence the date of this poem is
supposed to be 1525.</p>

<p>136. <i>Agnolo.</i> Michael Agnolo (less correctly, Angelo), 1475-1566, great
both as sculptor and painter.</p>

<p>149. <i>Francis.</i> Francis I of France was a patron of the arts. When
Andrea was thirty-two and had been married five years, King Francis sent
for him to come to Fontainebleau, the most sumptuous of the French royal
palaces. Andrea greatly enjoyed the splendor and hospitality of the
French court, and he was happy in his successful work, when Lucrezia
called him home. He obtained a vacation of two months and took with him
money with which to make purchases for the French king. This money he
used to buy a house for Lucrezia.</p>

<p>241. <i>Scudi.</i> Italian coins worth about ninety-six cents each.</p>

<p>261. <i>Four great walls.</i> <i>Revelation</i>, xxi, 15-17.</p>

<p>263. <i>Leonardo.</i> Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), one of the greatest of
Italian painters.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_222">THE BISHOP ORDERS HIS TOMB AT ST. PRAXED'S CHURCH</a></h3>

<p>There is an old church in Rome named in honor of St. Praxed or Praxedes.
The Bishop's Tomb, however, "is entirely fictitious, although something
which is made to stand for it is now shown to credulous sightseers."
(Mrs. Orr, <i>Handbook to Robert Browning's Works</i>, p. 247.)</p>

<p>Ruskin says of this poem: "Robert Browning is unerring in every sentence
he writes of the Middle Ages&mdash;always vital, right, and profound,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span> so
that in the matter of art, with which we are specially concerned, there
is hardly a principle connected with the medieval temper that he has not
struck upon in these seemingly careless and too rugged lines of his....
I know no other piece of modern English prose or poetry in which there
is so much told, as in these lines, of the Renaissance spirit&mdash;its
worldliness, inconsistency, pride, hypocrisy, ignorance of itself, love
of art, of luxury, and of good Latin. It is nearly all that I have said
of the central Renaissance, in thirty pages of 'The Stones of Venice,'
put into as many lines, Browning's also being the antecedent work."
(<i>Modern Painters</i>, Vol. iv, pp. 337-9.) "It was inevitable that the
great period of the Renaissance should produce men of the type of the
Bishop of St. Praxed; it would be grossly unfair to set him down as the
type of the churchmen of his time." Berdoe, <i>Browning Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, p.
81.</p>

<p>1. <i>Vanity, saith the preacher, vanity.</i> Cf. ll. 8-9, 51-52, as
illustrative of the religious professionalism of the Bishop's talk. He
drops into the ecclesiastical conception of life and death, and into the
phraseology of his order.</p>

<p>21. <i>Epistle-side.</i> The right-hand side facing the altar, where the
epistle is read by the priest acting as celebrant, the gospel being read
from the other side by the priest acting as assistant.</p>

<p>29. <i>Peach-blossom marble.</i> This rosy marble delights the Bishop as much
as the pale cheap onion-stone offends him. The lapis-lazuli, a rich blue
stone (l. 42), the antique-black (Nero-antico), a rare black marble (l.
34), the beautiful green jasper (l. 68), the elaborate carving planned
for the bronze frieze (l. 56-62, 106-111), show not only that the Bishop
covets what is costly, but that his highly cultivated taste knows real
beauty.</p>

<p>34. <i>That conflagration.</i> The eagerness of the Bishop for the lump of
the lapis-lazuli has made him steal even from his own church.</p>

<p>41. <i>Olive-frail.</i> A basket made of rushes, used for packing olives.</p>

<p>57. <i>Those Pans and Nymphs.</i> The underlying paganism of the Bishop
produces a strangely incongruous mixture on his tomb&mdash;the Savior, St.
Praxed, Moses, Pan, and the Nymphs.</p>

<p>58. <i>Thyrsus.</i> The ivy-coiled staff or spear stuck in a pine-cone,
symbol of the Bacchic orgy.</p>

<p>68. <i>Travertine.</i> A white limestone, the name being a corruption of
Tiburninus, from Tibur, now Tivoli, near Rome, whence this stone comes.</p>

<p>77. <i>Choice Latin.</i> The Bishop's scholarship was as good as his taste in
marbles. The <i>Elucescebat</i> ("he was illustrious") of l. 99 Browning
called "dog-latin" and he called "Ulpian, the golden jurist, a copper
latinist." (See letter to D. G. Rossetti. Quoted by A. J. George,
<i>Select Poems of Browning</i>, p. 366.) Tully's Latin was Cicero's (Marcus
Tullius Cicero), the purest classic style. The Grammarian in "<a href="#Page_183">The
Grammarian's Funeral</a>" was equally intense on a point of elegance or
correctness in the ancient languages.</p>

<p>80-84. The Bishop rejoices in all that has to do with the forms and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
ceremonies of the church. Note in ll. 119-121 his insistence on form and
order.</p>

<p>91. <i>Strange thoughts.</i> From this point on the Bishop's mind seems to
wander.</p>

<p>108. <i>A visor and a Term.</i> The visor is a mask. A term is any bust or
half-statue not placed upon but incorporated with, and as it were
immediately springing out of, the square pillar which serves as its
pedestal.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_227">CLEON</a></h3>

<p>The quotation preceding this poem is from <i>Acts</i> xvii, 28, and is, in
full, "As certain also of your own poets have said, 'For we are also his
offspring.'" The poet thus referred to by Paul was Aratus, a Greek poet
from Tarsus, Paul's own city. The Cleon and Protus of Browning's poem
are not historical characters, but they are representative of the tone
of thought and inquiry on the part of the Greek philosophers at the time
of Paul. Lines 1-158 give an account of the achievements of Cleon, a man
who has attained eminence in the various realms of poetry, philosophy,
painting, and sculpture. He is not in any one accomplishment equal to
the great poets, musicians, or artists of the past, and yet he
represents progress because he is able to enter into sympathy with the
great achievements in all these realms.</p>

<p>1. <i>Sprinkled isles.</i> Presumably the Sporades, the "scattered isles."</p>

<p>4. <i>Profits in his Tyranny.</i> Free government [in Greece] having
superseded the old hereditary sovereignties, all who obtained absolute
power in a state were called tyrants, or rather despots; for the term
indicates the irregular way in which the power was given rather than the
way in which it was exercised. Tyrants might be mild in exercise of
authority, and, like Protus, liberal in their patronage of the arts.</p>

<p>8. <i>Gift after gift.</i> Protus, a patron of the arts, shows his
appreciation of the work of Cleon by many royal gifts. Chief among the
slaves, black and white, sent by Protus, is one white woman in a bright
yellow wool robe, who is especially commissioned to present a beautiful
cup. Lines 136-8 are also descriptive of this girl.</p>

<p>41. <i>Zeus.</i> The chief of the Grecian gods.</p>

<p>47. <i>That epos.</i> An epic poem by Cleon engraved on golden plates.</p>

<p>51. <i>The image of the sun-god on the phare.</i> Cleon has made a statue of
Apollo for a lighthouse. <i>Phare</i> is from the island of Pharos where
there was a famous lighthouse.</p>

<p>53. <i>The P&oelig;cile.</i> The Portico of Athens painted with battle pictures
by Polygnotus.</p>

<p>69. <i>For music.</i> "In Greek music the scales were called moods or modes
and were subject to great variation in the arrangement of tones and
semitones." (Porter-Clarke, note in Camberwell edition.)</p>

<p>82. <i>The checkered pavement.</i> This pavement of black and white marble in
an elaborate pattern of various sorts of four-sided figures was a gift
to Cleon from his own nation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>100-112. The similitude is involved but fairly clear. The water that
touches the sphere here and there, one point at a time, as the sphere is
revolved, represents the power of great geniuses who, each at one point,
have reached great heights. The air that fills the sphere represents the
composite modern mind that synthesizes the parts into a great whole.</p>

<p>132. <i>Drupe.</i> Any stone-fruit. The contrast is between the wild plum and
the cultivated plum.</p>

<p>139. <i>Homer.</i> The poet to whom very ancient tradition assigns the
authorship of the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>. <i>Terpander</i>, the father of
Greek music, flourished about 700-650 B.C. Phidias, a famous Athenian
sculptor, lived 500-432 B.C. His friend was Pericles, the ruler of
Athens.</p>

<p>304. <i>Sappho.</i> A Greek poetess. She wrote about 600 B.C.</p>

<p>305. <i>&AElig;schylus</i>, a Greek tragic poet, 525-456 B.C.</p>

<p>340. <i>Paulus.</i> Paul died about 64 A.D. The date of this poem is
therefore about the last quarter of the first century A.D. Cleon had
heard so vaguely about the Christian religion that he did not know the
difference between Christ and Paul. The "doctrine" spoken of in the last
line was the Christian teaching concerning immortality. The Greek,
Cleon, had felt a longing to believe in another existence in which man
would have unlimited capability for joy, but Zeus had revealed no such
doctrine, and the cultivated Greek was not ready to receive it at the
hands of a man like Paul.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_239">ONE WORD MORE</a></h3>

<p>A poem directly addressed to Mrs. Browning. It was originally appended
to the collection of Poems called <i>Men and Women</i>. For other tributes by
great poets to their wives see Wordsworth's "She was a phantom of
delight," and "O dearer far than life and light are dear;" and
Tennyson's "Dear, near and true." Mrs. Browning's love for her husband
had found passionate expression in <i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Naming me.</i> Giving a name
<a name="corr7" id="corr7"></a><a class="correction" href="#cn7" title="changed from 'to to'">to</a> the volume for me.</p>

<p>5-31. Raphael's "lady of the sonnets" was Margharita (La Fornarina), the
baker's daughter, whose likeness appears in several of his most
celebrated pictures. The Madonnas enumerated in ll. 22-25 are the
Sistine Madonna, now in the Dresden Gallery; the Madonna di Foligno, so
called because it had been painted as a votive offering for Sigismund
Corti of Foligno; the Madonna del Granduca (Petti Palace, Florence) in
which the Madonna is represented as appearing to a votary in a vision;
and probably the Madonna called La Belle Jardiniere in the Louvre. There
is no evidence that Raphael wrote more than one sonnet, or three at
most. The "century of sonnets" attributed to him by Browning "is
probably an example of poetical license." The volume Guido Reni
treasured and left to his heir was a volume with a hundred designs by
Raphael. (Berdoe, <i>Browning Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, p. 297)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>32-57. Dante's chief work was his great poem, the <i>Inferno</i>, in which
were caustic sketches of evil men of various sorts. The sketch in the
lines 35-41 is made up from two descriptions (<i>Inferno</i>, Cantos 32, 33)
of traitors, the one to his country, the other to a familiar friend. The
second of these was still alive when Dante wrote (W. M. Rossetti,
<i>Academy</i>, Jan. 10, 1891). Beatrice, or Bice, was the woman Dante loved.
It was on the first anniversary of her death that he began to draw the
angel. Dante tells of this in the <i>Vita Nuovo</i>, xxxv, and there
describes the interruption of the "people of importance."</p>

<p>63-4. To Raphael painting is an art that has become his nature; to
Dante, poetry is an art that has become his nature. But this one time,
for the woman of his love, each chooses the art in which he may have
some natural skill but for which he has had no technical training.</p>

<p>73-108. The "artist's sorrow" as contrasted with the "man's joy" is
illustrated from the experiences of Moses in conducting the children of
Israel out of Egypt (<i>Exodus</i> xvii). His achievement savors of disrelish
because of the grumbling unbelief of the people, and because of the
ungracious irritation into which he has been betrayed even when taxing
his God-given power to the utmost in their behalf. He must hold steadily
to his majesty as a prophet or he cannot control and so serve the crowd,
but he covets the man's joy of doing supreme service to the woman whom
he loves.</p>

<p>97. <i>Sinai-forehead's cloven brilliance.</i> <i>Exodus</i> xix, 9, 16; xxxiv,
30.</p>

<p>101. <i>Jethro's daughter.</i> Zipporah, the wife of Moses. <i>Exodus</i> ii, 16,
21.</p>

<p>121. <i>He who works in fresco.</i> The fresco painter uses large free
strokes of the brush. But in order to give something distinctive to the
lady of his love he will try painting tiny illuminations on the margins
of her missal.</p>

<p>143. <i>Be how I speak.</i> That is, he usually writes dramatically, giving
the experience and uttering the words of the characters he has created,
such as the Arab physician, Karshish; the Greek Cleon; Norbert, the man
whom the Queen loved in "In a Balcony"; the painter, Fra Lippo Lippi;
the heroic pilgrim, Childe Roland; the painter, Andrea del Sarto. But
now, for once, he speaks in his own person, directly to the woman he
loves.</p>

<p>144-156. In Florence they had seen the new moon, a mere crescent over
the hill Fiesole, and had watched its growth till it hung, round and
full, over the church of San Miniato. Now, in London, the moon is in its
last quarter.</p>

<p>163. <i>Zoroaster.</i> Founder of the Irano-Persian religion, the chief god
of which, Varuna, was the god of light and of the illuminated
night-heaven.</p>

<p>164. <i>Galileo.</i> A celebrated Italian astronomer (1564-1642).</p>

<p>165. <i>Dumb to Homer.</i> Homer celebrated the moon in the "Hymn to Diana."
Keats wrote much about the moon and the hero of his poem "Endymion" was
represented as in love with the moon.</p>

<p>172-179. See <i>Exodus</i> xxiv.</p>

<h3><a href="#Page_247">ABT VOGLER</a></h3>

<p>Abb&eacute; (or Abt) Vogler (1749-1814) was a Catholic priest well known a
century ago as an organist and a composer. He founded three schools of
music, one at Mannheim, one at Stockholm, and one at Darmstadt. He was
especially noted for his organ recitals, as many as 7000 tickets having
been sold for a single recital in Amsterdam. In 1798 it was said that he
had then given over a thousand organ concerts. His knowledge of
acoustics and his consequent skill in combining the stops enabled him to
bring much power and variety from organs with fewer pipes than were
generally considered necessary. The remodeling and simplification of
organs was one of his most eagerly pursued activities. He not only
rearranged the pipes, but he introduced free reeds. Through some
skillful Swedish organ-builders he was at last enabled to have an organ
small enough to be portable and constructed according to his ideas. This
he called an "orchestrion." Of Vogler's power as an organist Rinck says,
"His organ playing was grand, effective in the utmost degree." It was,
however, when he was improvising that his power was most astonishing.
Once at a musical soir&eacute;e Vogler and Beethoven extemporized alternately,
each giving the other a theme, and Gansbacher records the pitch of
enthusiasm to which he was roused by
<a name="corr8" id="corr8"></a><a class="correction" href="#cn8" title="changed from 'Voglers'">Vogler's</a>
masterly playing. Three of
Voglers most famous pupils at Darmstadt were Meyerbeer, Gansbacher, and
Carl Maria von Weber. The last of these gives an attractive picture of
the musician extemporizing in the old church at Darmstadt. "Never," says
Weber, "did Vogler in his extemporization drink more deeply at the
source of all beauty, than when before his three dear boys, as he liked
to call us, he drew from the organ angelic voices and word of thunder."
Browning's poem records the experiences of the musician in one of these
moods of rapturous creation.</p>

<p>The argument of the poem is thus given by Mr. Stopford Brooke in <i>The
Poetry of Robert Browning</i>, page 149:</p>

<p>"When Solomon pronounced the Name of God, all the spirits, good and bad,
assembled to do His will and build His palace. And when I, Abt Vogler,
touched the keys, I called the Spirits of Sound to me, and they have
built my palace of music; and to inhabit it all the Great Dead came back
till in the vision I made a perfect music. Nay, for a moment, I touched
in it the infinite perfection; but now it is gone; I cannot bring it
back. Had I painted it, had I written it, I might have explained it. But
in music out of the sounds something emerges which is above the sounds,
and that ineffable thing I touched and lost. I took the well-known
sounds of earth, and out of them came a fourth sound, nay not a
sound&mdash;but a star. This was a flash of God's will which opened the
Eternal to me for a moment; and I shall find it again in the eternal
life. Therefore, from the achievement of earth and the failure of it, I
turn to God, and in Him I see that every image, thought, impulse, and
dream of knowledge or beauty&mdash;which, coming whence we know not, flit
before us in human life, breathe for a moment, and then depart; which,
like my music,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span> build
a sudden palace in imagination; which abide for an
instant and dissolve, but which memory and hope retain as a ground of
aspiration&mdash;are not lost to us though they seem to die in their
immediate passage. Their music has its home in the Will of God and we
shall find them completed there."</p>

<p>3. <i>Solomon.</i> In Jewish legend it is said that Solomon had power over
angels and demons through a seal on which "the most great name of God
was engraved."</p>

<p>13. <i>And one would bury his brow.</i> This description of the foundations
of the palace is not unlike Milton's account of the work of the fallen
angels in building the palace in hell. (<i>Paradise Lost</i>, I, 170.) That
"fabric huge" was as magical in its construction as the palace of Abt
Vogler, for, though it was not built by music, it</p>

<span class="i0">"Rose like an exhalation with the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>16. <i>Nether Springs.</i> Remotest origins.</p>

<p>23. <i>Rome's dome.</i> The illumination of St. Peter's was formerly one of
the customary spectacles on the evening of Easter Sunday. "At Ave-Maria
we drove to Piazza of St. Peter's. The lighting of the lanternoni, or
large paper lanterns, each of which looks like a globe of ethereal fire,
had been going on for an hour, and by the time we arrived there was
nearly completed.... The whole of this immense church&mdash;its columns,
capitals, cornices, and pediments&mdash;the beautiful swell of the lofty dome
... all were designed in lines of fire, and the vast sweep of the
circling colonnades ... was resplendent with the same beautiful light."
(C. A. Eaton, <i>Rome in the Nineteenth Century</i>, II, 208.)</p>

<p>23. <i>Space to spire.</i> From the wide opening between the colonnades to
the cross on the top of the lantern surmounting the dome.</p>

<p>34. <i>Protoplast.</i> Used apparently for protoplasm, a substance
constituting the physical basis of life in all plants and animals.</p>

<p>39. Into his musical palace came the wonderful Dead in a glorified form,
and also Presences fresh from the Protoplast, while, for the moment, he
himself in the ardor of musical creation felt himself raised to the
level of these exalted ones.</p>

<p>53. <i>Consider it well.</i> On the mystery of musical creation and on its
permanence see Cardinal Newman's sermon on "The Theory of Development in
Christian Doctrine." (Quoted in part, in Berdoe's <i>Browning
Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>.)</p>

<p>57. <i>Palace of music.</i> Cf. the description of the glowing banquet-room
in Keats's "Lamia":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A haunting music, sole perhaps and lone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supportress of the faery-roof, made moan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throughout, as fearful the whole charm might perish."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The damsel with the dulcimer in Coleridge's "Kubla Khan" sings of Mount
Abora, and the poet says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Could I revive within me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sympathy and song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To such a deep delight 'twould win me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That with music loud and long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would build that dome in air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sunny dome, those caves of ice!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all who heard should see them there."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Tennyson's "Gareth and Lynette" (l. 270), Merlin says to Gareth in
describing Camelot,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For and ye heard a music, like enow<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They are building still, seeing the city is built<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To music, therefore never built at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And therefore built forever."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are also more ancient accounts of this union of music and
architecture. Amphion, King of Thebes, played on his lyre till the
stones moved of their own accord into the wall he was building. When
King Laomedan built the walls of Troy, Apollo's lyre did similar service
to that of Amphion in Thebes. For an interesting account of "Voice
Figures" see <i>The Century Magazine</i>, May 1891.</p>

<p>64. <i>What was, shall be.</i> For this faith in the actual permanence of
what seemed so evanescent, compare Adelaide Procter's "Lost Chord."</p>

<p>69. <i>There shall never be one lost good.</i> Whatever of good has existed
must always exist. Evil, being self-destructive, finally "is null, is
naught." This is the Hegelian doctrine. Walt Whitman said on reading
Hegel, "Roaming in thought over the Universe I saw the little that is
Good steadily hastening towards immortality. And the vast all that is
called Evil I saw hastening to merge itself and become lost and dead."
(Berdoe, <i>Browning Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, page 40.)</p>

<p>81. <i>A triumph's evidence.</i> Failure in high heroic attempts seems to
point forward to some more favorable future where noble effort is
crowned with due success. Cf. "Cleon," lines 186-7:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Imperfection means perfection hid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reserved in part to grace the after time."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>96. <i>The C Major of this life.</i> The musical terms in this passage are
fully explained by Mrs. Turnbull and Miss Omerod in <i>Browning Society
Papers</i>. Symbolically this line describes the musician as he comes back
to everyday life, proud because of the vision that has been granted him,
but with a consciousness that experiences so exalted are not for "human
nature's daily food," and that their true function is to send one back
to ordinary pains and pleasures with a new acquiescence.</p>

<p>(In <i>The Browning Society Papers</i> are Mrs. Turnbull's "Abt Vogler," and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
three papers by Miss Helen Omerod: (1) "Abt Vogler the Man." (2) "Some
Notes on Browning's Poems relating to Music." (3) "Andrea del Sarto and
Abt Vogler.")</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_253">RABBI BEN EZRA</a></h3>

<p>Ben Ezra was an eminent Jewish Rabbi of the Middle Ages. His
<i>Commentaries</i> on the books of the Old Testament are of great value. Mr.
A. J. Campbell, who has studied Browning's poem in connection with the
writings of the real Rabbi Ben Ezra, thinks that the distinctive
features of the Rabbi of the poem, and the philosophy ascribed to him,
were drawn from the works of the historical Rabbi, the keynote of whose
teaching was that the essential life of man is the life of the soul, and
that age is more important than youth. (Berdoe, <i>Browning Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>.
Cf. also Berdoe, <i>Browning's Message to His Times</i>, pp. 157-172.)</p>

<p>1. <i>Grow old along with me.</i> Cf. <i>Saul</i>, lines 161-162. See Matthew
Arnold's "'Tis time to grow old" for a beautiful statement of the
pessimistic attitude toward old age.</p>

<p>7-15. It would be folly, says the Rabbi, to object to the unreasoning
ambitions, the fluctuations of desire, the hopes and fears of youth. In
fact (ll. 16-30), he counts these very aspirations toward the
impossible, this very state of mental and spiritual unrest and doubt, a
proof of the spark of divinity which separates men from beasts and
allies them to God. It is a characteristic Browning doctrine that
conflict, struggle, the pangs and throes of learning, are the stimuli
through which character develops.</p>

<p>40-42. Cf. <i>Saul</i>, l. 295.</p>

<p>49-72. In lines 43-48 the Rabbi had urged the subservience of the body
to the soul, but in these lines he shows that the life of the flesh is
not to be underestimated, that ideal progress comes from a just alliance
Of the soul and the body. See Tennyson's "St. Simeon Stylites" for an
account of the ascetic ideal in its lowest form.</p>

<p>81. <i>Adventure brave and new.</i> In "Prospice" death is reckoned an
adversary to be courageously met and overcome. Here the Rabbi is
represented as fearless and unperplexed as he contemplates the new life
he will lead after death. In both poems we find unquestioning belief in
an active and progressive and happy life after death.</p>

<p>85. <i>Youth ended, I shall try</i>, etc. Compare Tennyson's "By an
Evolutionist."</p>

<p>87. <i>Leave the fire ashes.</i> In this figure the "fire" stands for the
conflicts of life, the "gold" for whatever has proved of permanent
worth, and the "ashes" for whatever has failed to stand the test of time
and experience.</p>

<p>92. <i>A certain moment.</i> The moment between the fading of the sunset
glory and the shutting down of evening darkness is here selected as the
moment in which to appraise the work of the day. In the application of
the simile to the life of man (lines 97-102) the "moment" apparently
refers to old age when man has leisure and wisdom to appraise the Past.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>102. <i>The Future.</i> The life of his "adventure brave and new" after
death.</p>

<p>109-111. In "<a href="#Page_91">Old Pictures in Florence</a>" Browning applies this idea to the
<a name="corr9" id="corr9"></a><a class="correction" href="#cn9" title="changed from 'deveolpment'">development</a>
of art. As soon as men were content to repose in the
perfection of Greek art (the thing "found made") stagnation ensued; the
new life of art came when men strove for something new and original,
even though their first attempts were crude ("acts uncouth").</p>

<p>120. <i>Nor let thee feel alone.</i> The solitude of age gives a chance for
unhampered thought.</p>

<p>133-150. One of the things he has learned is that any judgment to be
fair must take into account instincts, efforts, desires, as well as
accomplishment.</p>

<p>151-186. This metaphor of the wheel is found in <i>Isaiah</i> lxiv, 8;
<i>Jeremiah</i> xviii, 2-6; <i>Romans</i> ix, 21. Throughout this metaphor as
Browning uses it, man seems to be "passive clay" in the hands of the
potter, and under the power of the "machinery" the potter uses to give
the soul its bent. The tone of the whole poem is, however, one of
strenuous endeavor. Ardor, effort, progress, are the keynotes of life
from youth to age. But life is finally counted a divine training for the
service of God, and in this training the pious Rabbi sees joined the
will of man and the care and guidance of God.</p>

<p>157. <i>All that is</i>, etc. Cf. "Abt Vogler," ll. 69-80.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_260">CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS</a></h3>

<p>The idea of this poem was evolved from Shakspere's Caliban, a strange,
misshapen, fish-like being, one of the servants of Prospero in <i>The
Tempest</i>. He was the son of a foul witch who had potent ministers and
could control moon and tides, but could not undo her own hateful
sorceries, and who worshiped a god called Setebos. Morally, Shakspere's
Caliban was insensible to kindness, had bestial passions, was cowardly,
vengeful, superstitious. He had keen animal instincts and knew the
island well. He understood Prospero in some measure; learned to talk, to
know the stars, to compose poetry, and took pleasure in music.</p>

<p><i>Thou thoughtest</i>, etc. A quotation from <i>Psalms</i> 1, 21. This sentence
is the keynote of Caliban's theological speculations.</p>

<p>1. <i>Will</i>. For "he will" instead of "I will." Through most of the poem
Caliban speaks of himself in the third person as a child does. But note
lines 68-97, where Caliban rises to unusual mental heights under the
stimulus of the gourd-fruit-mash and uses the first person. How is it in
ll. 100-108, 135-136, 160?</p>

<p>1-23. This portion of Caliban's soliloquy and the portion in lines
284-295 give the setting for his speculations. The hot, still summer day
creates a mood in which Caliban's ideas flow out easily into speech. The
thunderstorm at the end abruptly calls him back from his speculations to
his normal state of subservience and superstitious fear.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>24. <i>Setebos.</i> The god of the Patagonians. When the natives were taken
prisoners by Magellan, they "cryed upon their devil Setebos to help
them." Eden, <i>History of Travaile</i>.</p>

<p>25. <i>He.</i> The pronoun of the third person when referring to Setebos is
capitalized.</p>

<p>31. <i>It came of being ill at ease.</i> Each step in Caliban's reasoning
proceeds from some personal experience or observation. In this case he
reasons from the fish to Setebos. Caliban attributes to Setebos
unlimited power to create and control in whatever is comparatively near
at hand and changeable. But Caliban had been affected by the mystery of
the starry heavens. The remoteness and fixedness of the stars had
suggested a quiet, unalterable, passionless force beyond Setebos, who
must, therefore, have limitations. He did not make the stars (l. 27), he
cannot create a mate like himself (ll. 57-8), he cannot change his
nature so as to be like the Quiet above him (ll. 144-5). Hence, like the
fish, Setebos had a dissatisfied consciousness of a bliss he was not
born for. Discontent with himself, spite, envy, restlessness, love of
power as a means of distraction, are the motives that, according to
Caliban's reasoning, actuated Setebos in his creation of the world.</p>

<p>45. <i>The fowls here, beast and creeping thing.</i> Browning's remarkably
minute and accurate knowledge of small animals is well illustrated by
this poem. For further illustration see <i>Saul</i>, the last soliloquy in
<i><a href="#Page_325">Pippa Passes</a></i>, and the lyric "<a href="#Page_68">Thus the Mayne glideth</a>."</p>

<p>75. <i>Put case</i>, etc. In determining the natural attitude of Setebos
toward his creations, the formula Caliban uses is, Caliban plus power
equals Setebos. The illustration from the bird (ll. 75-97) shows
cruelty, and unreasoning, capricious exercise of power. The caprice of
Setebos is further emphasized in ll. 100-108.</p>

<p>117. <i>Hath cut a pipe.</i> In his attitude toward his creatures Setebos is
envious of all human worth or happiness if it is for a moment
unconscious of absolute dependence on him.</p>

<p>150. <i>Himself peeped late</i>, etc. As Caliban gets some poor solace out of
imitating Prospero, so one reason for Setebos's creation of the world
was a half-scornful attempt to delude himself into apparent content. His
imitations, his "make believes," are the unwilling homage his weakness
pays to the power of the Quiet.</p>

<p>170-184. The weaknesses of all living beings were special devices
whereby Setebos could, through need and fear, torture and rule.</p>

<p>185-199. Setebos worked also out of pure ennui. He liked the exercise of
power, he liked to use his "wit," and he needed distraction.</p>

<p>200-210. Setebos hates and favors human beings without discoverable
reason.</p>

<p>211-285. It is impossible to discover a way to please Setebos. His favor
goes by caprice as does Caliban's with the daring squirrel and the
terrified urchin, who please one day, and, doing the same things the
next,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span> would bring down vengeance. The only philosophy at which Caliban
can arrive is that it is best not to be too happy. Simulated misery is
more likely to escape than any show of happiness.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_271">MAY AND DEATH</a></h3>

<p>In memory of Browning's cousin, James Silverthorne, the "Charles" of the
poem. The "one plant" of the last two stanzas is supposed to be the
<i>Spotted Persicaria</i>, "a common weed with purple stains upon its rather
large leaves." According to popular tradition this plant grew beneath
the Cross, and the stains were made by drops of blood from the Savior's
wounds. (Berdoe, <i>Browning Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, page 268, quoting from Rev. H.
Friend, <i>Flowers and Flower Lore</i>.)</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_272">PROSPICE</a></h3>

<p>"Prospice" ("Look forward") was written in the autumn following Mrs.
Browning's death. "It ends with the expression of his triumphant
certainty of meeting her, and breaks forth at last into so great a cry
of pure passion that ear and heart alike rejoice. Browning at his best,
Browning in the central fire of his character, is in it." (Brooke, <i>The
Poetry of Browning</i>, page 251.)</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_273">A FACE</a></h3>

<p>"No poem in the volume of <i>Dramatis Person&aelig;</i> is connected with pictorial
art, unless it be the few lines entitled 'A Face,' lines of which Emily
Patmore, the poet's wife, was the subject, and written, as Browning
seldom wrote, for the mere record of beauty. That 'little head of hers'
is transferred to Browning's panel in the manner of an early Tuscan
piece of ideal loveliness." (Dowden, <i>Life of Browning</i>.)</p>

<p>14. <i>Correggio.</i> A famous Italian painter of the Lombard school. These
lines well describe his style.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_274">O LYRIC LOVE</a></h3>

<p>These are the closing lines of the first book of <i>The Ring and the
Book</i>. The passage is generally and probably rightly interpreted as an
invocation to the spirit of his wife.</p>

<h3><a href="#Page_275">A WALL</a></h3>

<p>This poem was written and printed as the Prologue to
<i><a name="corr10" id="corr10"></a><a class="correction" href="#cn10" title="changed from 'Pacchiarotte'">Pacchiarotto</a> and
How he Worked in Distemper</i>, published in 1876. It was, however, given
the title "A Wall" when published in 1880 in <i>Selections from Robert</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
<i>Browning's Poems, Second Series</i>. The last two stanzas express one of
the fundamental ideas of Browning's poetry. Under the figure of the wall
with its pulsating robe of vines and the eagerness of the lover to
penetrate to the life within the house, he sets forth his thought of the
barrier between himself and a longed-for future life in heaven. The
"forth to thee" is to be interpreted as referring to his wife.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_276">HOUSE AND SHOP</a></h3>

<p>Three of Browning's poems, "At the Mermaid," "House," and "Shop," refer
with more or less explicitness to Shakspere. The last stanza in "House"
contains a quotation from Wordsworth's "Scorn not the Sonnet" to the
effect that in his sonnets Shakspere revealed the most intimate facts of
his life. "At the Mermaid" and "House" both combat this idea. In "At the
Mermaid" Browning in the person of Shakspere says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Which of you did I enable<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Once to slip within my breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There to catalogue and label<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What I like least, what love best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hope and fear, believe and doubt of,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Seek and shun, respect&mdash;deride?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who has right to make a rout of<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Rarities he found inside?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As applied to Browning the poems represent the indignation with which he
regarded such personal revelations, such utterance of sighs and groans,
as characterized Byron (the "Last King" of "At the Mermaid"); but they
overstate the impersonal nature of Browning's own work which is
frequently a very direct statement of his own emotions and views, while
even from his dramatic work it is not difficult to find his "hopes and
fears, beliefs and doubts." In stanzas 10-12 of "At the Mermaid," for
example, just after he has protested against "leaving bosom's gate
ajar," he fully sets forth the joy, the optimism, of his own outlook on
life. "Shop" is an indirect protest against the assumption that
Shakspere wrote mainly for money, caring merely for the material success
of his work. (See <i>Poet-Lore</i>, Vol. III, pp. 216-221, April, 1889, for
Browning's tribute to Shakspere.) More directly the poem represents the
starved life of the man whom "shop," the business necessary to earn a
living, occupies "each day and all day long" with no spirit-life behind.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_282">HERV&Eacute; RIEL</a></h3>

<p>This poem was written during Browning's second visit to Le Croisic in
Brittany, in September, 1867. It was published in <i>The Cornhill
Magazine</i>, March, 1871, the proceeds of one hundred guineas being sent
by Browning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span> to the Paris Relief Fund, to provide food for the people
after the siege of Paris. The story is historic. Mrs. Lemoyne, in 1884,
read "Herv&eacute; Riel" to Browning and he then told her that it was his
custom to learn all about the heroes and legends of any town that he
stopped in and that he had thus, in going over the records of the town
of St. Malo, come upon the story of Herv&eacute; Riel, which he narrated just
as it happened in 1692, except that in reality the hero had a life
holiday. "The facts of the story had been forgotten, and were denied at
St. Malo; but the reports of the French Admiralty were looked up, and
the facts established." (Dr. Furnivall quoted in Berdoe, <i>Browning
Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>.)</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_289">"GOOD TO FORGIVE"</a></h3>

<p>This little poem was written and printed as the Prologue to <i>La Saisiaz</i>
in 1878, but in the <i>Selections</i> it appeared as No. 3 of
"Pisgah-Sights."</p>

the power of causing sudden fright by his voice and appearance. He came

they lost the battle.</p>

rulers of Athens. <i>Tettix.</i> A grasshopper. "The Athenians sometimes wore
golden grasshoppers in their hair as badges of honor, because these
insects are supposed to spring from the ground, and thus they showed
they were sprung from the original inhabitants of the country." (Berdoe,
<i>Browning Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, p. 336.)</p>

<p>12. <i>Reach Sparta for aid.</i> The distance between Athens and Sparta is

<h3><a href="#Page_302">MUL&Eacute;YKEH</a></h3>

<p>The love of the Arab for his horse is traditional. "The story is a
common one and seems adapted from a Bedouin's anecdote told in Rollo

<h3><a href="#Page_309">WANTING IS&mdash;WHAT?</a></h3>

<p>This poem is in the nature of a prelude to the group of poems published
under the title <i>Jocoseria</i>, 1883. Each poem in this volume shows the
lack of some element that would have brought the human action or
experience to perfection.</p>

<p>8. <i>Comer.</i> The invocation probably refers to the spirit of love with
its inspiring, transforming power.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_310">"NEVER THE TIME AND THE PLACE"</a></h3>

<p>This poem was published in <i>Jocoseria</i> in 1883. It is doubtless to be
grouped with the poems that refer directly to Mrs. Browning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>


<h3><a href="#Page_311">THE PATRIOT</a></h3>

<p>Browning says that this poem has no direct historical reference. He
calls it "An Old Story," because in all ages men have experienced this
unjust reversal of public approval. The poem is merely an imaginative,
dramatic representation of the fickleness of popular favor.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_312">INSTANS TYRANNUS</a></h3>

<p>The title of this poem means "Threatening Tyrant." It comes from
Horace's "Ode on the Just Man," in <i>Odes</i>, III, 3, i. The just man is
not frightened by the frown of the threatening tyrant&mdash;<i>non vullus
instantis tyranni</i>. Archdeacon Farrar refers the incidents to
persecution of the early Christians. The poem certainly deals with some
period when the ruler of a great realm had unlimited power to follow out
his most insignificant animosities, and when just men and just causes
had no human recourse.</p>

<p>The general idea of the poem is clear and forcible, but there are many
minor difficulties of interpretation.</p>

<p>6. <i>What was his force?</i> An ironic question. The man groveled because he
was powerless to resist, and (line 10) because resistance might bring
even worse punishment.</p>

<p>11. <i>Were the object</i>, etc. If the man could be made rich, if his life
could be crowded with pleasures, if there could be found relatives or
friends whom he loved, then there would be obvious ways of hurting him,
he would stand forth in sufficient importance to make the swing of the
tyrant's hand effective. But as it is, the man's poverty and
friendlessness and meagerness of life render it difficult to find out
vulnerable points of attack. He remains hidden (<i>perdue</i>) and, like the
midge of the egg of an insect (<i>nit</i>), is safe through his very
insignificance.</p>

<p>21. <i>spilth.</i> That which is poured out profusely. The <i>flagon</i> is a
vessel with one handle and a long narrow neck or spout.</p>

<p>35. <i>Then a humor</i>, etc. The tyrant goes through various changes of mood
in his attitude toward his enemy. In lines 35-43 he feels a moment of
contemptuous compunction at the man's suffering, and recognizes the
absurdity of a contest between a great king and a person as
insignificant as a tricksy elf, a toad, or a rat. But in line 44 his
mood turns. He perceives that the burden (<i>gravamen</i>) of the whole
matter lies in the incredibly petty nature of this unconquerable,
baffling opposition to his will. He sees how the situation would awaken
the wonder of the great lords who abjectly obey his lightest word, but
he concludes that, after all, the small becomes great if it vexes you.</p>

<p>53. <i>I soberly</i>, etc. Even the tyrant sees a kind of grotesque humor as
he narrates first the elaborate plans to entrap and crush so seem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>ingly
powerless a foe, and then the striking reversal of position when the man
proves to have God on his side, and the tyrant becomes the one to cower
in fear.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_315">THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND</a></h3>

<p>At the Congress of Vienna, in 1815, Lombardy and Venetia were assigned
to Austria. Most of the inhabitants submitted to the foreign rule, but
there were always small bands of patriots who stirred up revolutions
against Austria. The chief revolution was that led by Mazzini in 1848,
and when he was in exile he read this poem with much appreciation. In
<i><a href="#Page_325">Pippa Passes</a></i> (1840), in the story of Luigi and the Austrian police,
Browning had already given a picture based on Italy's struggle for
freedom. In 1844 he visited Italy and then wrote "The Italian in
England," which appeared in 1845. This poem does not represent a
definite historic incident, but such a one as might have occurred in the
life of some Italian patriot. For a similar feeling towards Italian
independence see Mrs. Browning's <i>Casa Guidi Windows</i> (written
1848-1851). For earlier poems see Byron's "Ode" beginning "O Venice,
Venice, when thy marble walls," Shelley's "Lines Written Among the
Euganean Hills," and the following sonnet by Wordsworth:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Once did She hold the gorgeous east in fee;<br /></span>

<h3><a href="#Page_321">"ROUND US THE WILD CREATURES"</a></h3>

<p>The first interlude in <i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i>. These interludes are love
lyrics which follow the separate Fables and Fancies of the Persian
Dervish Ferishtah, and state in terms of the affections the truth
embodied in didactic or philosophical fashion in the fables. In the
first fable, "The Eagle," the Dervish observes an eagle feeding some
deserted ravens. His first inference is that men will be cared for as
the ravens, without effort of their own; later he sees that men should
be as eagles and provide for the weak. The Dervish at once seeks the
largest sphere of human usefulness with the words</p>

<h3><a href="#Page_321">PROLOGUE TO ASOLANDO</a></h3>

<p>The volume of poems entitled <i>Asolando</i> was, by a strange chance,
published on the day of Browning's death. Most of these poems were
written in 1888-1889. The book was dedicated to Mrs. Arthur Bronson. The
"Prologue" should be compared with Wordsworth's "Ode on Intimations of
Immortality."</p>

<p>13. <i>Chrysopras.</i> The ruby and the emerald of this passage stand for
rich red and green. The chrysopras is also green (an apple green variety
of Chalcedony), but the first part of the word is from the Greek
&#967;&#961;&#957;&#963;&#959;&#962;, "gold," and that may be the color intended
here.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_323">SUMMUM BONUM</a></h3>

<p>The title means, The Chief Good. The poem came out in <i>Asolando</i> in
1889.</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_324">EPILOGUE TO ASOLANDO</a></h3>

<p>In the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, Feb. 1, 1890 the following incident is given
concerning the third stanza of this poem:</p>

<p>"One evening just before his death illness, the poet was reading this
from a proof to his daughter-in-law and sister. He said: 'It almost
looks like bragging to say this, and as if I ought to cancel it; but
it's the simple truth; and as it's true, it shall stand.'"</p>

<p>Compare this poem and Tennyson's "Crossing the Bar."</p>


<h3><a href="#Page_325">PIPPA PASSES</a></h3>

<p>Mrs. Sutherland Orr writes that while Browning was one day strolling
through Dulwich Wood "the image flashed upon him of someone walking ...
alone through life; one apparently too obscure to leave a trace of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
or her passage, yet exercising a lasting though unconscious influence at
every step of it; and the image shaped itself into the little
silk-winder of Asolo, Felippa, or Pippa."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Introduction</span></h4>

<p><i>Asolo in the Trevisan.</i> Asolo, a fortified medieval town at the foot of
a hill surmounted by the ruins of a castle, and situated in the center
of the silk-growing and silk-spinning industries, is in the province of
Treviso about thirty-three miles northwest of Venice.</p>

<p>62. <i>Monsignor.</i> A title conferred upon prelates in the Roman Catholic
church. This Monsignor is the chief personage in Part III, or <i>Night</i>.</p>

<p>88. <i>Martagon.</i> A kind of lily with light purplish flowers. The common
name is Turk's Cap. Perhaps that suggested to Browning his comparison to
the round bunch of flesh on the head of a Turk bird, or turkey.</p>

<p>131. <i>Possagno church.</i> Designed by Canova, who was born at Possagno, an
obscure village near Asolo.</p>

<p>181. <i>The Dome.</i> The Duomo, or Cathedral, in the center of the town. The
palace of the Bishop's brother is close by.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Morning</span></h4>

<p>28. <i>St. Mark's.</i> There is an extensive view from Asolo. Venice, with
its cupolas and steeples, is seen to the east. Ottima detects the belfry
of the Church of St. Mark. The towns of Vicenza and Padua are also
discernible.</p>

<p>59. <i>The Capuchin.</i> A branch of the Franciscan order of monks. Their
habit is brown.</p>

<p>170. <i>Campanula chalice.</i> The flower of any one of a large genus of
flowers with bell-shaped corollas.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Interlude I</span></h4>

<p>27. <i>El canibus nostris.</i> Virgil, <i>Eclogues</i> iii, 67. "<i>Notior ut jam
sit canibus non Delia nostris</i>"&mdash;"So that now not Delia's self is more
familiar to our dogs." The boy Giovacchino of whose poetry they are
making fun evidently had ideals not in harmony with the ways of these
Venetian art students. These "dissolute, brutalized, heartless
bunglers," as Jules calls them, attack with quick, clever, merciless
tongues whatever savors of idealism, aspiration, purity. Their revenge
for the scornful superiority manifested towards them by Jules is to
secure, by a well-managed trick, a marriage between him and a paid
model.</p>

<p>86. <i>Canova's gallery.</i> Possagno was the birthplace of the sculptor
Canova, and the circular church there was designed by him. In the
gallery at Possagno is his Psyche (<i>Psiche-fanciulla</i>, or Psyche the
young girl); his Piet&agrave; (the mother with the dead Christ in her arms) is
in the church.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>111. <i>Malamocco.</i> A little town on an island near Venice.</p>

<p>111. <i>Alciphron.</i> A Greek writer (about 200 A. D.) of fictitious letters
famous for the purity of their style and for the knowledge they give of
Greek social customs.</p>

<p>115. <i>Lire.</i> Plural of lira, an Italian coin equal to 18.6 cents in our
money.</p>

<p>117. <i>A scented letter.</i> Forged letters have represented this fourteen
year old, ignorant model as delicate, shy, reserved, intellectually
alert, with lofty poetic and artistic ideals.</p>

<p>117. <i>Tydeus.</i> One of the Seven Allies in the enterprise against Thebes.
Jules is supposed to have modeled a statue of him for the Venetian
Academy of Fine Arts. From Scene II, 14, we see that it is still in
clay.</p>

<p>120. <i>Paolina.</i> Some actress at the Phenix, the leading theater of
Venice.</p>

<p>140. <i>Hannibal Scratchy.</i> In jest they burlesque the name of Annibale
Caracci, a famous Italian artist, and apply it to one of their number.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Noon</span></h4>

<p>39. <i>This minion.</i> This favorite. Bessarion (1395-1472), a learned Greek
cardinal, discovered a poem, "The Rape of Helen," written by a Greek
epic poet, Coluthus, in the sixth century, and Bessarion's scribe copied
it out on parchment with blue, red, and dark-brown lettering.</p>

<p>43. <i>Odyssey.</i> Homer's account of the adventures of Ulysses. The quoted
passage is in the <i>Odyssey</i>, Bk. <span class="smcap">XXII</span>, 10. When Ulysses reached home he
wreaked vengeance on the suitors of his wife. Antinous was the first to
fall. The story of the "bitter shaft" blotted out by a flower is
symbolic of the story of the hatred of Lutwyche, which was robbed of its
bitterness by Phene's love.</p>

<p>50. <i>Almaign Kaiser.</i> The German Emperor. <i>Swart-green</i> is really
"black-green"; here it means the "dark-green" of bronze. The Emperor's
truncheon is a short staff, the emblem of his office.</p>

<p>54. <i>Hippolyta.</i> The Queen of the Amazons on a fine horse from Numidia.</p>

<p>59. <i>Bay-filleted.</i> The bay or laurel with which victors were crowned
was supposed to be an antidote against thunder because it was the tree
of Apollo. Pliny says that Tiberius and some other Roman emperors wore a
wreath of bay leaves as an amulet, especially in thunder-storms. (See
Brewer, <i>Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</i>; also Byron, <i>Childe Harold</i>,
<span class="smcap">IV</span>, 41.)</p>

<p>61. <i>Hipparchus.</i> In B. C. 514 Harmodius and Aristogeiton conspired
against the tyrants Hippias and Hipparchus, and carrying swords hid in
myrtle, they slew Hipparchus. Cf. Byron, <i>Childe Harold</i>, III, 20.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">"All that most endears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glory, is when the myrtle wreathes a sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as Harmodius drew on Athens' tyrant lord."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></div></div>

<p>75. <i>Parsley.</i> An aromatic herb used in ancient time in crowns worn at
feasts.</p>

<p>86. <i>Archetype.</i> The original pattern or model. Beautiful colors and
shapes in flowers, in flames, trees, and fruit suggested to the poet the
beauty of perfect human forms. The rosy bloom of the peach bending close
over the bough and nestled among the leaves is sufficient to suggest
rosy limbs, and from that suggestion comes the whole imaginative picture
of the dryad, the nymph of the woods.</p>

<p>95. <i>Facile chalk.</i> Jules exults in the facility with which the artist,
in any realm of art, manipulates his implements and his materials. His
especial enthusiasm is for marble, which he has come to regard as an
original, primitive substance, containing in itself all other
substances. It may be made to seem as light and clear as air, as
brilliant as diamonds. Sometimes as his chisel strikes, it seems to be
metal. Again it seems to be actual flesh and blood. At moments when the
sculptor works with swift intensity it seems to flush and glow like
flame.</p>

<p>181. <i>I am a painter</i>, etc. The poem by Lutwyche is professedly "slow,
involved, and mystical." But Jules gradually perceives the purport of
the words. Lutwyche's hate is to have its most hideous possible aspect
because it is to appear suddenly through Love's rose-braided mask.</p>

<p>272. <i>The Cornaro.</i> Catharine Cornaro was the wife of James, King of
Cyprus. After his death she was induced to abdicate in favor of the
Republic of Venice, which took possession of Cyprus in 1487. She was
assigned a palace and court at Asolo. She was generous, kind, just, and
deeply beloved. Her life seemed to hold all possible external conditions
of happiness. The song is further explained in lines 275-279.</p>

<p>306. <i>Ancona.</i> A lovely city in eastern Italy.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Interlude II</span></h4>

<p>1. <i>Bluphocks.</i> Browning's note on this character reads, "He maketh his
sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just
and on the unjust." (<i>Matthew</i> v, 45.)</p>

<p>2. <i>Your Bishop's Intendant.</i> The Bishop's Superintendent (whose real
name is Maffeo) has charge of the estate the Bishop has just inherited
from his brother. The money Bluphocks has is the bribe given him by
Maffeo to destroy Pippa, who is really the heir to the estate. Maffeo
expects the Bishop to reward him well for this service.</p>

<p>11. <i>Prussia Improper.</i> "The arm of land bounded on the north by the
Baltic and on the south by Poland was long called 'Prussia Proper' to
distinguish it from the other provinces of the kingdom. K&ouml;nigsberg is
just over the boundary of Brandenberg." (Rolfe, <i>Select Poems of
Browning</i>.)</p>

<p>14. <i>Chaldee.</i> A Semitic dialect.</p>

<p>21. <i>Celarent</i>, <i>Darii</i>, <i>Ferio</i>. Coined words used in logic to
designate certain valid forms of syllogism.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>24. <i>Posy.</i> A brief inscription or motto originally in verse, and
suitable for a ring or some trinket.</p>

<p>25. <i>How Moses</i>, etc. For the story of Moses and the plagues of Egypt
see <i>Exodus</i> viii and x. For the story of Jonah (who was commanded,
however, not to go to Tarshish) see <i>Jonah</i> i. For Balaam and his ass
see <i>Numbers</i> xxii, 22.</p>

<p>33. <i>Bishop Beveridge.</i> There was a Bishop of that name, but of course
Bluphocks is making a pun.</p>

<p>35. <i>Charon's wherry.</i> Charon was a god of hell. It was his business to
carry the dead across the river Styx. People thus carried over the
Stygian ferry paid Charon by a small coin put between their lips.</p>

<p>36. <i>Lupine-seed.</i> "In plant-lore 'lupine' means wolfish, and is
suggestive of the Evil One." (Berdoe, <i>Browning Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>.)</p>

<p>36. <i>Hecate's supper.</i> Hecate was a goddess of hell to whom offerings of
food were made. An <i>obolus</i> is a silver coin worth about fifteen cents.</p>

<p>39. <i>Zwanziger.</i> A twenty-kreuzer piece of money.</p>

<p>47. <i>Prince Metternich.</i> A celebrated Austrian statesman. (1773-1859.)</p>

<p>54. <i>Panurge.</i> A prominent character in <i>Gargantua and Pantagruel</i> by
Rabelais. Hertrippa is a magician who gives Panurge advice on the
subject of marriage. Bluphocks is simply racking his brain for words to
rhyme with "Pippa," so that he may write doggerel poetry to or about
her. For "King Agrippa" see <i>Acts</i> xxvi, 27.</p>

<p>77. <i>Carbonari.</i> All persons leaving a city had to have a passport
officially signed giving the destination and the date of departure.
Luigi had obtained such a passport for Vienna for that night. It was,
however, suspected that this was a mere trick to give a wrong notion of
his whereabouts. If the passport should prove to be a pretense, other
suspicions against Luigi would be confirmed; it would be taken for
granted that he belonged to the Carbonari, a secret society of Italian
patriots; he would be arrested and sent to the prison at Spielberg. But
if he should go to Vienna he is to be let alone. The officers are, of
course, on the wrong track. If Luigi goes to Vienna it is to carry out
his purpose of killing the tyrant. If he stays in Asolo it means that he
has abandoned that purpose.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Evening</span></h4>

<p>6. <i>Lucius Junius.</i> This name comes easily to Luigi's lips because
Lucius Junius Brutus inspired the Romans against Tarquin.</p>

<p>14. <i>Old Franz.</i> The Austrian Emperor, Francis, I. Luigi's fancy is
caught by the echoes and the flowers, but they play into his dominant
idea of the freedom of Italy.</p>

<p>19. <i>Pellicos.</i> Silvio Pellico was an Italian patriot who had suffered a
long imprisonment in Spielberg Castle.</p>

<p>122. <i>Andrea</i>, etc. Three former Italian patriots who had conspired
against Austria.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>135-143. Note in these lines how little Luigi really understands of the
point at issue. His emotional temperament has been stirred to the point
of desperate action, but the "ground for killing the King" he hardly
knows.</p>

<p>152. <i>Jupiter.</i> The largest of the planets. When a planet rises after
midnight it becomes a morning star.</p>

<p>163. <i>Titian at Treviso.</i> Treviso is seventeen miles from Venice. Its
cathedral contains a fine Annunciation by Titian which Luigi and his
betrothed
<a name="corr11" id="corr11"></a><a class="correction" href="#cn11" title="changed from 'Chiari'">Chiara</a>
had planned to see together.</p>

<p>164. <i>A king lived long ago.</i> This song was published in 1835 and later
adapted for this poem. The song has a great effect on Luigi because
beside his mental picture of the hated Austrian ruler he now places his
old folk-king who judged his people wisely, whose dignity and grace awed
even a python, and whom the gods loved. The possibility of having good
kings stirs his waning determination to rid the earth of evil ones.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Interlude III</span></h4>

<p>6. <i>The same treat.</i> The feast of the girl is made up of fig-peckers
(birds that feed on figs), lampreys (eel-like fish esteemed a delicacy),
and red wine from
<a name="corr12" id="corr12"></a><a class="correction" href="#cn12" title="changed from 'Breganza'">Breganze</a>,
a town noted for its wines.</p>

<p>17. <i>Spring's come</i>, etc. These girls are well differentiated. The
"first girl" is set apart from the others by her superior refinement, by
her longing for her country home, and by her unhappiness with Cecco. The
"third girl" seems to be the leader in the plan against Pippa.</p>

<p>22. <i>Deuzans</i>, etc. Varieties of apples.</p>

<p>64. <i>Ortolans.</i> Birds about the size of larks, and an expensive
delicacy.</p>

<p>66. <i>Polenta.</i> A coarse corn-meal pudding.</p>

<p>89. <i>Great rich handsome Englishman.</i> Bluphocks, who has been hired by
the Intendant to lure Pippa into evil courses.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Night</span></h4>

<p>1. <i>Monsignor.</i> The Bishop has come from Messina in Sicily to take
possession of his dead brother's estate. The "Ugo" to whom he speaks is
the Intendant mentioned at the beginning of <i>Interlude II</i>.</p>

<p>4. <i>Benedicto benedicatur.</i> A form of blessing for the repast. "Let it
be consecrated with a good saying."</p>

<p>9. <i>Assumption Day.</i> The festival of the Assumption of the Virgin into
Heaven comes August 25.</p>

<p>36. <i>Jules.</i> This is the Jules of <i>Noon</i>. His history is thus carried on
beyond the point where we left him at the close of his interview with
Phene.</p>

<p>51. <i>Correggio.</i> An Italian artist (1494-1534).</p>

<p>72. <i>Podere.</i> (Plural, <i>poderi</i>.) A small farm or manor.</p>

<p>83. <i>Cesena.</i> An Episcopal city about twelve miles from Forli.</p>

<p>108. <i>Millet-cake.</i> A cake made of an Italian grain and eaten only by
the poorest classes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>135. <i>Letter No. 3.</i> The information from Rome is based on a wrong
assumption. The elder brother had an infant heir whom the second brother
endeavored to put out of the way in order that he might himself inherit
the estate. He hired Maffeo to destroy the child, and, according to the
information from Rome, Maffeo did so. On this assumption Maffeo is to be
arrested and the money and land given him by the second brother to keep
the deed a secret are now to revert to the church.</p>

<p>154. <i>So old a story.</i> In reality Maffeo has been more astute than they
thought. He did not kill the child but kept it ready to produce as the
heir to the estates if the second brother at any time proved delinquent
in the required payments.</p>

<p>174. <i>Let us understand one another.</i> He believes that when the Bishop
sees himself about to lose the estate, he too will show himself ready
for a bargain. The Bishop is simply to keep still and Maffeo will see
that the heir&mdash;who is Pippa&mdash;shall be finally brought to shame and
death. The Bishop is to have the estates, and Maffeo is to keep his
ill-gotten gains and be given a chance to escape. The Bishop is
apparently listening to the tempter when he hears Pippa's song. Its
fresh lilting sweetness, and especially, perhaps, the wording of the
last line, touch his heart and his conscience, and he suddenly orders
Maffeo's arrest, at the same time uttering the prayer, "Have mercy upon
me, O God."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Epilogue</span></h4>

<p>7. <i>My Zanze.</i> Zanze was evidently the "third girl" who took Pippa in
charge at the end of <i>Interlude III</i>.</p>

<p>30. <i>Monsignor's people.</i> Zanze was apparently talking to Pippa under
the Monsignor's window. Pippa broke off the unwelcome talk by her song,
and Zanze had hardly time to begin again when there came the noise of
the arrest of Maffeo.</p>
